            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:4169:3"/> hereunto that we our ſelues by moſt certain arguments of God, do perceiue daily, howe grate nede of ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregacions haue, becauſe they be vtterlye deſtitute of godlie, and lerned miniſters, and therefore no ſincere, and certayne doctrine is handled amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g our men, where as yet the ſame ought alwaies to be preched, and taught before old men, and younge. For we perceiue that of thys neglectinge of perfecte, and pure doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, horrible ignorance of God, pernitious ſuperſticion, vnbelefe, moſt greuous fautes and confuſion of all good thinges folowe neceſſarely.</p>
            <p>Therefore whan we perceyued that the ſaide thynges preuailed horribly it ſemed that we ought to make no longer delaie, but rather we thought vpon the emendation of theſe thinges, and conſulted aboute the ſame erneſtly, &amp; cheifely in this our extreme olde age which ſurely warneth vs, that we muſt ſhortely come before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt, where we knowe that we muſt giue an accompe of this office enioyned vnto vs. Wherefore that we myght firſt ſhewe oure ſelues obedient to our ſaniour, and the Lord Chriſte the prynce of paſtours, and to hys flocke, and ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly acknowlege our ſupreme officer the emperour and finally ſeke the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeruacion,

Wherefore we nether woulde nor coulde delaie our purpoſe of a reformacion.

After the ſame ſort ſayth Eſay. xl. Al fleſh is graſſe, and al the glory therof is as the flour of the felde, the graſſe wythereth, and the floure fadeth. But the word of the lorde abideth for euer. Seing then that men of theyr owne nature be deceyued, and can not of them ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande the doctrine of grace, and ſeinge that theyr glorie or excellencie (by whiche worde the prophete would chiefely ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie mannes wyſedome) falleth awaye lyke a floure, howe can mannes reaſon, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, when it is not guyded and directed by the ſpirite and worde of God, perceyue and teache anie certentie, and truth, chiefely concernyng diuine matters, and the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man.

Wherfore in thys lyfe there neyther hath ben, nor is anie man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued wyth ſo great holines, or doctrine, but that it hath chaunced hym often to fall, and to be deceyued. Wherefore as Saynte Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, ſo lykewyſe other fathers and olde doctours allowed not all the writinges and ſentences of them, whiche had taughte ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before them, or in theyr tyme for thys cauſe, that thoſe thynges came from men ſo excellent in godlines, and learnynge, but as farre as euerie man confirmed his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, <note place="margin">The ſame an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tour in the E<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piſtle to ſaint Hierome.</note> and ſentence with the worde of God, and ſure reaſons.

Fyrſte that the articles of oure fayth be confirmed wyth ſure, and euident teſtimonies of the ſcripture.

As when Arrius denied that the ſonne of God ſprange out of the ſubſtaunce of the father, and that he was god by nature, he corrupted the true ſentence of thys ſaiyng. And God was the worde. For he ſayed, that thys vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable God in this place did not ſignifie god <note place="margin">Iohn. i.</note> which by nature, &amp; almightines is God but ſome excellent creature paſſinge all other in maieſtie, &amp; dignitee. This falſe interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:4169:17"/> holy goſte by the apoſtle Paule hath layed vpon all biſhoppes, and miniſters of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, <note place="margin">i.

               <p>Wherfore it perteyneth to the miniſters of the worde to teache the people diligently that al the promiſes, and benifittes exibited to the fathers (yea vniuerſally to Iſraell, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem the threates, puniſhmentes, and precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, ſaueing thoſe that perteyne to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde diſcipline, and ciuilitie of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which ought to ſtande in effecte onely, tyl the tyme of Chriſt) belonge vnto vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.

               <p>Wherefore it perteyneth to preachers, to applie handſomely vnto vs the promiſes, and threates propouned to the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſundrie wayes, aſwel in open ſermons of the lawe, as in exemples, and therof they muſt euer diligently warne the people, that God wyl bountuouſly exhibite his healpe, and gyue them all good thynges, beleuyng in hym, and obeyinge his commaundemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie wyſe that he wyl vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly rendre puniſhemenent aſwell preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in the lyfe to come, to the vnfaythfull and deſpicers of his worde. Theſe thynges ſhal cauſe the people to be returned, and fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thered in the feare, and zeale of God.</p>
               <p>As for the difference of the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the olde, and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</note> made with the fathers, and the newe inſtituted, by Chriſt, &amp; the apoſtles: it is thre folde. Firſt becauſe the olde Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was made wyth Abraham onely, and his ſeede namely the people of Iſrael after the fleſhe,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> and wyth them, whiche outwardelye alſo embraced the ſame religion. But the newe Teſtamente was made wyth all men, and nations thorowe the whole worlde, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie as beleue the Golſpell, and become his chyldren thorowe fayeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe in the olde Teſtament beſide fayth, &amp; obedience of the law, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, &amp; other outward rytes of ceremonies were required. But in the new Teſtament nothyng is required, but fayth, &amp; loue wyth the fruites of thoſe vertues and a fewe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which Chriſt him ſelfe did ordaine.</p>
               <p>Thyrdely, for that, that God had not yet opened ſo clearly to the olde people the grace of the Mediatoure Chriſte, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he helde them in great feare, and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. But the whole miſterie of Chriſte is more fully reueiled to the newe people, and a greater libertie of outwarde thynges is grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. For in the new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t there is no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of perſonnes, places, or ciuilitie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, but Chriſte bad that his goſpel, ſhould be preached to euery creature, that al men of all nations ſhoulde be called to his kingdom, affirming that al ſhould be ſaued, that ſhoulde beleue and be baptiſed. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paule alſo wrate that thoſe heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted, were not now ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, but
<pb facs="tcp:4169:42"/> the citizens of the ſaintes, and houſholde of God. This in the ſteede of circumciſion, and other ceremonies, with which thei were innumerably laden in the olde Teſtament, Chriſte hath lefte ſacramentes wyth hys church, as S. Auguſtine ſayth, verie few in nombre, moſte certaine in obſeruation, and moſte reuerende in ſignification, that is to ſaye, baptiſme, and the celebration of his bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dye, and bloude Finally he hath nowe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the myſteries of hys grace much more clearely, than in tymes paſte to the fathers and he hath powred vpon vs more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly the ſpirite of ad optio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and hath mad vs fre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Moſaical rites, &amp; al rudime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of the world. And he ſo gouerneth our hertes with his ſpirite, that of our owne accorde we ſubmitte oure ſelfe to euerie ordinaunce of man for the profit of our neighbours, ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pliynge oure ſelfe to euery mannes health and edificacion towardes ſaluation, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uinge plainly with a free, and wyllinge ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, not conſtrained,</p>
               <p>Furthermore they muſt obſerue that there is other maner of ſpeakynge of the olde te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, whiche Paule, and the prophetes than vſe, whan they reproue the vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the Iewes in the Teſtament, and lawe of God, whiche they obſerued onely
<pb facs="tcp:4169:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> outwardly, with out fayth in Chriſte. For in this place they ſhewe, what the olde Te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtament <note place="margin">After what ſorte ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded in olde tyme.</note> is, and what it aualeth wyth out grace, and fayth in Chriſte. Of whiche Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>remie ſpeaketh cha. vii. Thys ſayeth the Lord of hoſtes, the God of Iſrael, put your brunt offeryngs to your ſacrifices, and eate felſh. for I ſpake not to your fathers, and I gaue them no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement in the daye whan I brought them out of the laude of Aegipte, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerninge brunte offringes, and ſacrifices but I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them this thinge ſaiynge, heare my voyce, and I wilbe your God, and you ſhalbe my people and walke in all the wayes that I haue commaunded you, that you maye be in good caſe. Lo the Lorde witneſſeth that he gaue not the lawe of brunte offringes, and ſacrifices, that he commaunded hys people notinge concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter which thinge the prophete ſpake not abſolutely of the lawe, but as it was corruptly obſerued of the vngodly Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, whiche though they ſtil apeace prouo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked God with al maner of wickid deedes, yet they laboured in vaine to appeaſe God with ſacrifices done with out repentaunce and fayth, That the prophete than myght more ſtrougly throwe doune thys falſe con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fidence in them, vſinge an hyperbolical, or
<pb facs="tcp:4169:43"/> exedynge ſpeache, he ſayeth that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded nothynge concernynge ſacrifices. For God ordeyned ſacrifices for thys pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that in them faith towardes God and Meſſias myghte be exerciſed, not that a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of ſinning, and careles lyuing ſhould be eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>In lyke maner. S. Paule ſpeaketh of the olde Teſtament to the Gala. iiij. Where he maynteyneth the doctrine of the Goſpell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte falſe apoſtles, whiche taughte that fayeth in Chriſte ſufficed not vnto ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that men had neede of circumciſion, and other Moſaicall ceremonies, whereby it came to paſſe, that while they deſpiced the grace of Chriſt, they retayned nothynge of the lawe and the olde Teſtamente, but the letter, and a certayne outwarde viſour. For he that putteth not all hys hope, and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſte onely, hath nowe caſt away Chriſte altogyther. Wherefore that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle myghte open more euidently to the Galathians, that the lawe, and ceremonies, of Moyſes do not profitte nowe, wythout Chriſte, yea that they hurte verie muche. He compareth the olde Teſtamente to Hagar Abrahams handmayde, and the newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of Chriſt to free Sara.

               <p>But God made not his couenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nether with Abraham, nor with Moyſes for thys ende, that thei ſhould glory in the lettre, and prerogatiue of the fleſh, refuſing Chriſt, but that they ſhould put al theyr truſt, and hope of ſaluation in the promiſed Meſſias, for whoſe ſake god would be theyr ſauiour and protectour, and they thorow the faith of the ſame meſſias ſhould be the people, and wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhyppers of God.

So in an other place he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pareth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of Moyſes wyth the miniſtery of the Goſpell, and newe Teſtamente, and he teſtifieth that the fyrſte is the miniſterie of the lettre, and of domnation, as it is in dede to al them, whoſe hertes God hath not pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged with the fayth of his ſonne, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto them the new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of grace and adoption of the chyldren of God tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the holie goſte, whiche gyueth witnes vnto our ſpirite, that we be the chyldren of God, and teacheth vs to cal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God with confidence, and affection of chyldren, and to crye Abba, O father.

Paule alſo, the law is a guide vnto Chriſte. But the falſe Apoſtles wyth whom Paule fighteth in no wyſe taughte this vſe of the olde Teſtament, but they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that Moſaical ceremonies muſt be keepte of neceſſitie, euen in the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that we ſhoulde not ſeeke for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in Chriſte onely. As they then abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the miniſterie of Moiſes againſt Chriſt and to make the fayth of Chriſte of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſo they made the Teſtament of ſuche ſort vnto them ſelues, as the Apoſtle calleth the miniſterie of the lettre, and of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Out of thys maner of ſpeakynge of the olde Teſtamente the lawe and Moyſes his ceremonies, cometh it that S.

               <p>The epiſtle to the Hebr. ſpeaketh alſo of thys abrogation of the olde Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing. The olde Teſtament is abrogated, and aboliſhed. But the couenaunt of the olde te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, as it was made of God wyth the olde ſayntes, is euerlaſtynge, and conſiſteth herein, that he ſheweth and exhibiteth hym ſelfe vnto them a God, a gyuer of eternall lyfe, and that they be his people. Thys co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt
<pb facs="tcp:4169:45"/> of God wyth the choſen is eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thorowe the preachynge of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the olde Teſtamente is fulfylled wyth the newe.</p>
               <p>And though all the couenauntes of gods beniuolence, whiche from the begynnynge of the worlde haue bene made wyth men, were obteyned and confirmed, thorowe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte, whiche renueth our hertes, and onely writeth the lawe in them, neuertheles the knowledge of Chriſte, and a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull dealynge forth of the holie goſte was gyuen after the aſcention of Chriſte, and preachynge of the Goſpell publiſhed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the worlde.

               <p>Onely as I ſayed the glorie, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſte was further, and more plentyfull reueyled after the aſcention of

               <p>For whiche cauſe Saynt Paule magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth ſo greatlie the rytches of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamente, and calleth it a miſterie hydden from the begynnynge of the worlde, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge that it was reueyled in the tyme of the Goſpell by the Apoſtles thorowe the holie Goſte, namely that the heathen be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriters, and of the ſame body with the olde people, and partetakers of the ſame promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Chriſte Ieſu.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if after thys ſorte the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſhall diſcerne, and declare the thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that as well in common, as appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly be attributed in the ſcriptures to the olde, and newe Teſtamente, they ſhall teache the people the wrytynges of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, and Apoſtles more certaynlye, and more fruitefullye, and beynge truely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed vnto the kyngdome of God, as a rytche and liberall houſeholder, they ſhall brynge out of the treaſures of the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res all the promiſes, threates, exemples, and commaundementes of God deliuered vnto both the people.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4169:46"/>
               <p> And they ſhall declare that in al the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes euen of bodily thinges the promiſes <note place="margin">Howe Chriſt is encloſed in al the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> of grace in Chriſt, and euerlaſtyng lyfe, be encloſed.

               <p>By theſe teſtimonies it is euident, that <note place="margin">A double preachyng of the Goſpell.</note> there be two partes of the preachinge of the goſpel, or newe teſtament, that is to ſaye, a preachinge of repentaunce, and of remiſſion of ſinnes.

               <p>This is a verie euangelical, and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an repentaunce.

               <p>And becauſe Chriſte our Lorde is the onely glaſſe and exemplar of a godly lyfe, we maie learne certainly, and ſubſtantially out of the lyfe and obedience of Chriſte, to what maner of lyfe we be made, and called what ſtubburnes ther is in vs agaynſt god and what corruption of nature whereby ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely we haue deſerued, that we ſhulde ſuffre eternally thoſe puniſhmentes that the ſonne of God ſuffred for vs, ſeynge that inobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſtubburnnes agaynſte God do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer remayne in vs.</p>
               <p>Hereof it commeth that the Apoſtles in theyr ſermons as we maye ſee in the actes, were wonte to ioyne together the deathe, and reſurrection of Chriſte, as the principal poyntes of Chriſtian doctrine, which al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4169:52"/> ought euer to haue in theyr ſight.

               <p>Wherefore thorough the preachinge of the paſſion, and death of Chriſt they exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the people to acknowledge theyr ſinnes and to repent truly, and by the teſtimonies of the reſurrection they ſtirred them vp to fayth and truſte of grace, and for gyuenes of ſynnes. For they that can truly beleue, and perſwade them ſelues that the ſonne of God was ſmitten for theyr ſinnes, and that the horriblenes of oure ſynnes is ſo greate, that it behoued the ſonne of god to ſuffre ſo ſhameful, and cruel a puniſhmente for the purgation of them, while he would redeme vs from eternal death, theſe men vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly ſhalbe aſhamed, &amp; repentaunt of theyr ſinnes, &amp; ſuch men ſhal abhorre excedinglye and feare ſynnes.

Item, hym whiche knew not ſinne he made ſinne for vs, that is to ſaye a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſynne. The Apoſtle doeth the ſame thynge in manie other places, where he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lureth to a newe lyfe, and to amendement, that is to ſaye, to true repentaunce, Epheſi. iiij. Philip. ij. iij. and. Collo. ij. and in other places. For whiche cauſe alſo in mentioning both the Sacramentes, Baptiſme, and the the ſupper of the Lorde, he preacheth of the death, and paſſion of Chriſt.

For as often as ye ſhall eate thys breade, and drynke of this cuppe, ye ſhall ſhewe forth the death of the Lorde tyll he come. So. S. Petre ſayeth alſo.

               <pb facs="tcp:4169:54"/>
               <p> Secondly we muſt knowe thys alſo, that there is a double vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng of the law. <note place="margin">A double vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandinge of the lawe.</note> The fyrſte is fleſly, and groſſe, when men thynke that onely outwarde actes are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the lawe, whiche if a man auoyed metely wel, he hath ſatiſfied the law, though there remayne ſtyll in the mynde euyll affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and concupiſcence repugnant and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Surely thys vnderſtandynge of the lawe, is a falſe and a verie heathniſhe erroure, whiche maketh nothing els then hipocrites, of whiche ſorte that phariſee was ſtandyng in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, and praying, I thanke the God that I am not, as other men be raueners, vn iuſte, adulterers, as alſo thys publicane is.</p>

               <p>And as for the preachynge of free remiſſion of ſynnes thorowe Chriſte, and the ryghtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of fayeth, they are either offended wyth it, or deſpice it, as foliſhe.

               <p> But God which is ritche in mercie gaue his ſpirite, the teacher of all truth to manie of them both before, and after the geuynge of the lawe, wythout the miniſterie of thys lawe, onely thorowe the comon lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and doctrine receiued from the fathers And by thys ſpirite they both knewe, and dyd the thynges that pertayne to the lawe, and were to them ſelues in ſteede of a lawe. Of whiche thynges they coulde do none, thorow the only light of that nature, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyth they were borne into thys world. For ſeinge that Paule coulde not acknowledge ſynne without the lawe gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; reueiled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue, vndoubtedly the doctrine of the law of God is neceſſarie to all men, that they maye knowe theyr ſynne therby. Wherfore the lawe muſte be ſette forth, and repeted to the people wyth all diligence, that they may learne to haue it euer in theyr eyes, and to conſidre it reuerently, and to directe theyr myndes, and all theyr doinges thereunto, that thorow true and ſubſtantial knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng of ſynne, a lyuely repentaunce of the ſame maye be prycked vp.</p>
               <p>For that is a true, and holeſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſynne, when we do not onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, what ſynne is, but alſo that we are giltie of ſynne. And the lawe was gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4169:60" rendition="simple:additions"/> to ſteare vp in vs, ſuch a knowledge of ſinne For it ſayeth not onely that murther, auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, thefte, and ſuche lyke, be ſynnes, but it ſayeth, kyl not thou, yea be not angrie with out a cauſe, committe not thou auoutrie, yea deſire not an other mannes wyfe, ſteale not thou, yea defraude not thy neyghboure in anie buſines. He that heareth theſe thynges wyth a purged mynde, and lyghtened wyth the ſpirite of adoption, acknoledgeth that it is required in the law, that we embrace and perfourme the thinge that God commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth wyth all our herte, wyth all our ſoule, and wyth all our ſtrength, and that we all togyther abhorre from that, that he forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, wyth al our vnderſtandynge, all oure wyll, and all our nature. Therefore when a man perceyueth that he is yet farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this true obedience, and ſtudie of Goddes lawe, he acknowledgeth hym ſelfe, though he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteyne outwardly from murther, adulterie, theft and fraude of his neighbour, to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles before God a murtheer, an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, and a thefe, and to be in daunger for giltines of all theſe euyls. For all be it that he hath not conceyued in his mynde ani re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengeaunce, luſte, or wronge, nor hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte the ſame (whereof no man wyl lightly boſte) neuerthels he ſhall fynde
<pb facs="tcp:4169:61"/> in him ſelfe an inclination, and a readines of mynde to the ſame miſchiues. Thus when he laboureth to lift vp his mynde vnto ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlenes, liberalitie, and patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his mynde repugnynge, and euer wyth drawyng it ſelfe from thoſe dedes, and if it be ſomewhat ſteared vp thereunto, yet he perceyueth it to faynt therin, and not to be moued, and to burne wyth ſo greate deſire, as it ſhoulde.</p>
               <p>But this luſt to do euil, this repugnau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to good, this difficultie, ſlownes, fayntnes, and ſlarkenes be verie ſynnes before God, becauſe they be agaynſte the lawe of God, whiche of right requireth of vs, that we do the thinges, that he commaundeth vs to do moſte deſirouſly, and abhorre the thynges that he forbiddeth with al our herte, and all our ſtrength, ſo that we abhorre nothynge more in all oure lyfe.</p>
               <p>Here of it appeareth playnly, that we are taughte by the lawe of God, whyle we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde it after the meaning of Chriſt, that we be not onely ſinners, but alſo priſoners, and ſolde vnder ſynne. For we can not repreſſe in any wiſe thoſe inward motions with our owne ſtrength, which thing whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we learne, and acknowledge out of the lawe, then we haue a true, and an holeſome knowledge of
<pb facs="tcp:4169:61" rendition="simple:additions"/> the lawe. Therfore as the Apoſtle teacheth diligently, and beateth in thys knowledge of the law, ſo al preachers muſt be moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to teach, and print the ſame in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, omitting the ſubtile diſputations of the lawe, that make nothinge to the purpoſe. For while they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually beate in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial obſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the law, which Paule teacheth, they ſhall ſteare vp in men a true knowledge of ſynnes, and thereby a lyuely and effectuous repentaunce, and a careful, and earneſt conuerſation vnto Chriſte. For they that geue them ſelues earneſtly to thys perfecte obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the law, and turne their lyfe thereunto, ſhall muche better perceyue, then anie man can teache, how great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is of nature, and howe greate ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of ſynne in vs.</p>
               <p>An other ſayinge of Paule, whereby we may know the true vſe of the lawe, is thys. The lawe worketh wrath, wherwith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſignifieth, that we do not onely not acknowledge ſin of our ſelues, but alſo neg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lecte it when we haue acknowledged it, and diſpice careleſly the iudgement, and wrath of god againſt ſynne, which the law threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, as though God were not ſo much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with our ſinnes, as the ſcripture wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, and as though he could wynke at
<pb facs="tcp:4169:62"/> them. Where as yet Dauid teſtifieth, that God wyl not iniquitie. For thus he ſayeth: Thou arte not the God, that wylleth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. And thou hateſt al that worke iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſhalt deſtroy them that ſpeake lyes.</p>
               <p>Wherfore God would fraye, ſteare, and moue vs agayne wyth his heauenly voice, that we myght feele his wrath in oure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. And thys he doeth wyth threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges of puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and miſeries, which he added to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes in the law, both corporall, and euerlaſtynge manie ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and ryght horribly, and al ſinners ſhal ſuffre them, if they repent not, and be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thorowe Chriſt. Therfore the preachers muſte diligently declare to the people theſe puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes &amp; miſeries, that at length they maye vnderſtande the wrath of God, and feele it in theyr co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, that being frayed wyth the intollerable iudgement of God, they may be ſteared to ſeke grace in Chriſt, and deliueraunce from thys wrath of God.</p>
               <p>Hereof it appeareth ſufficiently that the law was not geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to teſtifie, and to quicke, but that thorowe it we mighte vnderſtande that ſynne raygneth myghtely in vs, and that we ſhoulde ſeeke an other waye, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we myghte come into Goddes fauoure, and obtayne that lyfe, that the Goſpell ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:62" rendition="simple:additions"/> namely fayeth in Chriſt. Wherof. S Paule wrate to the Galathians. iij. For if there had bene a lawe, that had bene able to quycken, ryghtuouſnes had ben of the lawe in dede. But the lawe iuſtifieth not, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth, while it preſcribeth, and requireth that, that God requireth of man to be done, and threateneth death, and hell to all them, that perfourme not the thynge, that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth and requireth, whiche thynge no man can do. For we are ſo deſtitute of the glorie of God, and true ryghtuouſnes, ſo ſolde to ſinne, and plainly ſo dead, as Paule witneſſeth, that the law it ſelf, which ſhould be a remedie vnto vs, and brynge vs againe to lyfe, is turned into oure deſtruction, and caſteth vs further into hell, concupiſcence beinge ſteared vp thorowe it, and ſynne encreaſed.</p>
               <p>Wherefore thys is the vſe of the whole lawe, that it ſhewe vs thys oure perdition thorowe ſynne, and that it dryue vs (beinge ſtryken wyth true griefe for ſyne, and wyth the feare of Goddes iudgement, and being deſtiſtute of all hope of ſaluation to begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten otherwyſe) to Chriſte the ſauiour, which thorowe his paſſion, and death hath remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the wrath of God from vs, hath obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fauoure, gyueth the ſpirite of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:63"/> thorowe whiche ſpirite beinge ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and ſtrengthened, we are dryuen forth to worke well, and we are ſtayed wyth this conſolation, that he is oure onely Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure, and Sauiour, whiche maye ſette his perfect obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and rightuouſnes betwene the father, and vs, and at length in the reſur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rection wyll deliuer vs from all ſynnes, and gyue vs perfecte ryghtuouſnes.</p>
               <p>The thyrde place of Paule is thys. The <note place="margin">The lawe is our guyde or ſcholemaiſter to Chriſte.</note> law was made vnto vs a ſcholemaiſter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt. Thys ende then of the lawe muſt be diligentlye declared and repeted in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. For all we haue yet neede of thys ſcholemaiſtringe, accordyng to the meaſure of fayth, and the ſpirite gyuen to euery one. For there remayneth a greate weakeneſſe in vs all, by reaſon whereof we haue neede thorowe the feare of the ſeruile ſpirite, to be euer dryuen to Chriſte, and to be kept in the obedience of God, vnto a fulle libertie of the ſpirite of chyldren.</p>

Therefore it ſhall pertayne to the preachers, whyle they exhort to good workes, to beate in diligently the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes of the lawe, the promiſes, and threates ioyned to the commaundementes. Howe be it they muſte do it wyth ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that togyther wyth principall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, they teache that it is Chriſte onely, that worketh the true obedience of the lawe, and that he ſatiſfied thorowe his obedience that, that wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted in ours, wherin there is no perfection. For as longe as we lyue here, oure obedience is verie ſclender, and vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte, nor ſatiſſieth the lawe at anie tyme, whiche lawe ſetteth thys marke of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that we loue God wyth our whole herte, our whole ſoule, and all our ſtrengh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes. Wherefore thoſe places in the lawe, and in the prophetes that preache of Chriſt, <note place="margin">Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lawe leadeth and remitteth to Chriſte.</note> whereof there be manie in the ſcripture, ſhal be declared, and commended to the people wyth greate diligence.</p>
               <p>For the lawe profiteth vs not onely in this poynte, that thorouge the knowledge of ſynne, whiche it ſtirreth vp, and the feare of Goddes wrath, whiche it cauſeth, it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb facs="tcp:4169:64"/> vs agayne to Chriſte, and keepeth vs thorough obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce towardes god, in Chriſt and yet by none other ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt but alſo it magnifieth, and ſheweth Chriſt wyth pleaſaunte preachinge, and remitteth and leadeth ſweetely vnto hym, becauſe it preacheth hym be the onely obteiner of mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie, and our ſauiour, whiche thinge it doeth two maner of waies, Firſt with plaine, and open teſtimonies, as thys is, that we reade in Deutro. xxiii. The Lorde ſhal raiſe vp to the a prophete ſyke me. Secondly wyth ſha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dowes, and pleaſaunte allegories, as that is of the paſcal lambe. So the prophetes alſo prophetied of Chriſt many waies, and more openly and ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifully the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Moyſes, til at the laſt Iohn baptiſte ſhewed hym with his ſin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger beinge preſent. Al whiche thinges muſt be preached, &amp; expouned to the people wyth greate diligence out of the lawe, and the prophetes.</p>
               <p>Theſe than be the cauſes, why the lawe was gyuen, whyche God knewe that we would not keepe, namely that being taught and admoniſched thorough it, we ſhoulde acknowledge our weaknes, and infirmitie, and feele the excidinge wrath of God, and thorowe a certaine Godly diſcipline be led vnto Chriſte, &amp; put al our truſt in him and
<pb facs="tcp:4169:64" rendition="simple:additions"/> appliynge good workes, ſhoulde growe in to hym daylye, whiche is the heade, beynge furniſhed wyth all Godlynes, and vertue. After that the miniſters ſhalbe inſtructed of the lawe, and haue taught the people fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, than they ſhal both them ſelues vſe the lawe a ryght, and ſhal bringe the people in to the true knowledge of it, &amp; ſhall moue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to true repentaunce, and griefe for theyr ſynnes, and ſo ſtirre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp, and driue them vnto Chriſte the redemer, to ſerue him with al deſire.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the commen people can nat vndreſtande and remembre al the preceptes of the lawe, ſeynge that they be verye ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and euerye one hath a large dominion, the preachers muſte after recite and printe in the myndes of the hearers: the briefe ſum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes, and cheife articles of Goddes law, as that is, that we haue in Math. xxii. Thou ſhalte loue the Lorde thy God wyth thy whole herte, and in thy whole ſoule, and in thy whole mynde. Thys is the principall, and greate commaundement.

               <p>Secondly that thorowe the preaching of the Goſpell, and baptiſme, he hath receyued vs into his people, as in olde tyme he recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Iſraell, bryngyng him out of Egipte,

<pb facs="tcp:4169:70" rendition="simple:additions"/> daye, the preachers ſhal teache, fyrſte that it is commaunded that in thoſe appoynted ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes when the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation is wont to come togither to heare the worde of God, to pray and to receyue the ſacramentes, all chriſtian men aſſemble thyther ſetting aſyde al other buſines, chiefely on the ſondayes, and holie dayes, and that they heare the holie leſſons deuoutly, gyue ſomewhat to the poore, vſe the ſacramentes. etc. For we muſte all ſeeke an encreaſe, and confirmation of fayeth, and of al godlines for our ſelues, and for them that be committed to theyr charge thorowe theſe inſtrumentes of religion, whiche the Lorde hym ſelfe gaue and commended vnto vs for that purpoſe, and we muſte thorowe oure exemples approue mayntaine, ſet forth and commende to other the common mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the congregation, and the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the worde, and ſacramentes, and other eccleſiaſticall offices. And moreouer, euerie Chriſtian man ought priuately with hym ſelfe, and wyth his familie to exerciſe hym ſelfe often, and buſely in readyng the holy ſcriptures, and in prayers. Therefore preachers ſhal fyrſt teache that this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the thyrde commaundement.</p>
               <p>Secondly they ſhal teache that in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundemente oure vice and vngodlines is
<pb facs="tcp:4169:71"/> ſhewed vnto vs, foraſmuche as we neglecte holie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies, the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deling of Gods word, the participation of the ſacramentes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exerciſes of religion, and bicauſe it is paynefull to vs to appeare in the ſyghte of God our father, and there to learne the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowledge of him, and his wyl towarde vs, and to gyue him thankes wyth worthy magnifying of his name, and holy gyftes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they ſhall teache that the Lorde diſcloſeth vnto vs the vice of oure nature to thentent to cal vs to the repentaunce therof, and to dryue vs to Chriſt, which turneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his wrath agaynſt the ſame ſynne, and repreſſeth it dayly more and more wyth his holy ſpirite, and gyueth vs ſtrength to reſiſt that euil, and kendleth in vs a loue of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doctrine, prayer, ſacramentes, al holy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles, and exerciſes of religion, chiefly of them that be vſed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> holy dayes. For ſuch daies we muſt with principal ſtudie, &amp; reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſanctifie to the Lorde, and ceaſſe from bodili workes, and ſeculer buſines, and giue our ſelues wholly to the exerciſes of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Howe be it we muſte alſo at other ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes come diligentlye togyther to praye, to heare, and to learne the worde of God, and priuately euery man ought to gyue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendaunce for his owne parte, and with his
<pb facs="tcp:4169:71" rendition="simple:additions"/> houſholde, to reading of the ſcripture, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation and prayer, as we haue ſayd. For all theſe thynges this piece of the lawe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sabbath, ſhalbe our ſcholemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter vnto Chriſte, if it be applied to our life. After the ſame maner concerning the fyrſte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, honour thy father, and thy mother, the people muſte be taughte that by the honour of our parentes, it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that we honour al them, which exhibite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs fatherly and motherly kindnes, either in teachyng, and warnyng thynges that be Godly, and wholeſome, or in miniſtrynge neceſſarie thynges for our lyfe, or in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wronge, of whiche ſort the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and paſtours be chiefely, and the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile officers, whiche we oughte to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to heare and to worſhippe, as our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with al humilitie, obedience, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes. And bycauſe there is no man but at ſome tymes he maye do vs ſome good turne, the preachers ought to teache the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that God requireth in thys commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement al that, that. S. Paule commaunded to the Ro. xiij. ſaying, go one before an other in honour. Item to the Phil. ij. Let nothinge be done by contention, or vayne glorie, but thorowe humilitie of mynde let euerie man thynke an other better then hym ſelfe.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4169:72"/>
               <p> Secondly it muſt be taughte out of thys commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that we haue ſuch natural pryde, that we wyl ſubmit our ſelues to no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>body, obey nobody, nor requite the benifites that we haue receuied, wherof ſpring many variaunces, diuiſions of myndes, and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of al neceſſary frendſhyp.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, thei muſt teach that God tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the diſcloſyng of this euyl, would ſter vs vp to true, &amp; holſome repentaunce, &amp; driue vs to Chriſt the ſauiour, whiche turneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye the wrathe of God, that we deſerue with this vice, and mortifieth the remnaunt thérof in the fleſhe throughe the holye goſt, and bringeth vs ſo ferfurth, that we ſtudye dayly to repreſſe that naturall arrogantie, and pryde, and that we compte worthy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and do worſhyp our parentes, our ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical curates, and other ciuile gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and al thoſe that do vs good in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, warnyng, counſel, correction, or with any other benefitte, and further al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with whom we lyue, euery one accordyng to his ſtate, and dignitie. Moreouer that we take al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and rebukes in good worth, ſubmitte our ſelues gladly vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obeye theyr pleaſure, and recompence theyr benifittes, that thorowe out al oure lyfe, we maye do good to many vnto the glorye of
<pb facs="tcp:4169:72" rendition="simple:additions"/> God wyth our moderation, obedience, and thankfulnes. Whereunto thys precepte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceruynge the honouryng of oure parentes, ought to be our ſcholemaiſter into Chriſte.</p>
               <p>But in thys commaundement it is not to be omitted that. S. Paule moniſheth vs of, that it is the fyrſt with promiſe. For it hath a peculiar, and large promiſe of longe lyfe, in the lande whiche the Lorde our God gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, namely in whiche God is called vpon and worſhipped, whereupon his eyes loke to ſhewe bountiouſnes on it. For it beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them to haue longe lyfe in the people of God, whiche ſubmitte them ſelues, and ſhewe them ſelues obedient, and thankefull to theyr parentes, to the powers, and to all men.</p>
               <p>So in the ſixte comaundement the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſhal teache, fyrſte that by manſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all violence and wronge agaynſt the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of our neighbours, al reuengeaunce, and vniuſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motion of the mynde, angre, wrath hatred, enuye, and all ſignes, wordes, and dedes that come of angre be forbidden, as Chriſte hym ſelfe interpreted thys ſayinge Mathewe. v.</p>
               <p>Secondly they ſhal teach that God war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth vs in thys precepte of oure natural ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, iniquitie, and impacience: Thorow
<pb facs="tcp:4169:73"/> whych vices it cometh to paſſe, that we can ſuffer nothyng that is vnpleaſaunt vnto vs but wee wyll haue all other to folowe oure luſtes, though they be naughti and infinite, where as we in the meane ceaſone wyll not onely omitte to do the thinges that be right and good to our neyghbours, but we wyll alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte many vnrightful and vnſeame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thynges.</p>
               <p>God than wyll condemne wyth thys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement oure naturall ignoraunce, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patientnes, luſte, and thoſe that ſpryng ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I meane anger hatred, enuy, brawlynge, fyghtyng. etc. And God wyl ſet before oure eyes howe euyl theſe thinges be, forbidding ſlaughter by name, but aſwel that, that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted wyth the mynde, as wyth the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Whereby he requireth that as we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre all ſlaughter, ſo we ſhoulde abhorre all cauſes, and affection of ſlaughter, and to do our neighbour any wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge. Thirdly they ſhall admoniſhe, that God wyll with thys precepte when our vice is knowen, prouoke vs to repent it, and dryue vs to ſeeke his grace, and mercie in Chriſte, whiche onely appeaſeth the wrath of God deſerued tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe theſe our euylles, and aboliſheth, and mortifieth the remnauntes thereof with the holy goſte, and worketh, and encreaſeth ſoft<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="tcp:4169:73" rendition="simple:additions"/> in vs, that we maye ouercome the vice of impatientnes, and frowarde way ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in other, wyth oure patience, gentlenes, and humanitie, and recompence wronges done, wyth benifittes, and be gentle, and good towardes all men, forgyuynge as Chriſte hath forgyuen vs. Ephe. iiij. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto thys commaundement miniſtreth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs an inſtruction in Chriſte.</p>
               <p>In the ſeuenth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, thou ſhalt not committe auoutrie, the people ſhall be taughte, that God forbiddeth, and damneth all copulations beſide matrimonie, whiche he hym ſelfe ordeyned, and moreuer al luſt, and inordinate motions, all intemperaunce, al delites and pleaſures vnſeamely for chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtian men, al riote and vncomelines in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, drynkes, garmentes, geſture, wordes, and dedes, of whiche any cauſe of vnchaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes may riſe, or of any perturbation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the bodie ſhall be made vnpliable, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and ſtubburne towarde the ſeruice of the ſpirite.</p>
               <p>Secondly that God warneth and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs in thys commaundement of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural lecherie, fylthy, and immoderate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupiſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in al thynges, whiche he him ſelfe gaue to ſuſteyne, and cheriſhe our bodies.</p>
               <p>Thyrdly that thorow the knowledge of
<pb facs="tcp:4169:74"/> thys diſeaſe we are dryuen to repentaunce of the ſame, and to ſeeke the grace, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Chriſte, whiche turneth away the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wrath deſerued thorowe thys euyll, and whiche quencheth the remnauntes of thys diſeaſe remaynynge in the fleſhe, and worketh in vs true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinencie, chaſtitie, and perfecte holines in all thynges, that beinge healped wyth the aſſiſtence of the holy goſt we maye reſiſte euyl concupiſcences, and al intemperaunce, cleanſinge oure ſelues from all fylth of the fleſhe, and of the ſpirite, and workynge holines wyth the feare of God. ij. Cor. vij. To the perfourmaunce wherof thys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement warneth and ſteareth vs, as a ſcholemaiſter.</p>
               <p>Lykewyſe out of the eight commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thou ſhalt not ſteale, we muſte learne that God here, by theft forbiddeth al fraud and wronge in matters perteyuynge to the vſe of thys lyfe. And furthermore all coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes, nigardnes, deſire of more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other haue, and ſlacknes of due liberalitie.</p>
               <p>Secondly that in thys commaundement God warneth and accuſeth vs of thys co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes, deſire of more, carefulnes, &amp; ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardnes in thinges pertaining to this lyfe.</p>
               <p>Thyrdly that he dryueth vs thorow the knowledge and condemnation of this euyl
<pb facs="tcp:4169:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> to repentaunce therof, and fayth in Chriſte, whiche remoueth the wrath of God deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thorowe thys erockednes, and damned deſire, and repreſſeth the ſame in vs, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie wyſe ſteareth vp, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth ſuche truſte of his goodnes that we maye ſurely certifie oure ſelues that God the heauenly father regardeth vs, and hath care of vs, and that he wyl miniſtre al thinges aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntly, wherby we may ſuſteyne, cheriſhe and alſo delite this our life. Thorow which truſte beinge rayſed vp, let vs alſo learne to exerciſe true liberalitie towardes our neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour leauing of all carefulnes for this lyfe, and let vs gyue liberally to al men of that, that the almightie hath gyuen vs, aſmuche as we be able, and aſmuche as the neceſſitie of oure neighboure requireth. Whereunto this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t exhorteth vs, as a ſchole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter.</p>
               <p>In the ninth precept we muſt teache that God by falſe wytneſſe forbiddeth all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and ſayinges, yea ſilence, and diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling of witneſſe, and priuie prayſe, whereby the fame and reputation of our neighbours is hurted, or not defended, as we would haue ours to be defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of other. Finally al falſe and vayne ſpeache, that profiteth nothynge neither them to whom it is ſpoken, nor them
<pb facs="tcp:4169:75"/> of whom it is ſpoken. Secondly that God wyll brynge vs to acknowledge thys cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature, this ambition, male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence, enuie. etc. wherewyth we diminiſhe the eſtimation and excellencie of other, and diſſemble, neglect, yea and often couer, and darken the thynges that pertayne to the prayſe, and reputation of our neighbour.</p>
               <p>Thirdly that God wyll thorowe the knowledge of thys oure frowardnes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vs to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therof, &amp; raiſe vp in vs a diligence and deſire to cal for the grace of Chriſte, whiche came to pacifie thys wrath of God agaynſte theſe oure euylles, and to quenche them in vs wyth his holie ſpirite, and to beginne ſuche humilitie of mynde, ſuche loue of an others dignitie, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, that we be delited with the good eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, honeſt fame, and worthy praiſes of other, and that we wyll labour to ſet forth thoſe good thynges, wyth no leſſe diligence then our owne fame, and dignitie, and that we vſe in al our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication truth, honeſt interpretation and gentlenes, to the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hearers, ſpeaking alwayes thoſe thynges to other, and of other, as we wiſhe other to ſpeake to vs, and of vs, wyth a right iudgement of the ſpirite.</p>
               <p>In the tenth commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, thou ſhalt
<pb facs="tcp:4169:75" rendition="simple:additions"/> not couette etc. They muſt fyrſt teache, that by the couetynge of an others thynges, as his houſe, wyfe, familie. etc. all euyll concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence is generally prohibited, and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, motions, and prones to euyll, and al lothſomnes, and neglecting of good wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes. Secondly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt be diligently war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned of this, that they loke exactly vpon this commaundement, and to examine wel them ſelues accordyng therunto. For in it God pulleth vp by the rootes, and ſetteth before our eyes the vniuerſall corruption of oure nature, and the inwarde frowardnes, and deprauation of the ſame, that in thys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement as in a glaſſe we myghte ſe, howe wretchedly, and horribly we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued, and loſt thorough the fall of Adam in all our bodye, all our ſoule, and all oure ſtrength, that we maye inſtly crye with the Apoſtle, wretched man that I am, who ſhal deliuer me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bodie of thys death? For though ſome ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come ſo farre by the grace and healpe of God, that he acknowledge God wyth true fayth, that he worſhyp, and call vpon hym, as the fyrſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement requireth, neither regardeth ſtraung Gods nor admitteth falſe worſhippynge of God, neither in purpoſe of mynde, nor in wordes and dedes, whiche thynge the ſeconde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
<pb facs="tcp:4169:76"/> forbiddeth, neyther thynketh, ſpeaketh, or doeth anie thynge that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the confeſſion, and ſanctification of Goddes name, whiche thynge the thirde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundement requireth, and that he be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently occupied in all exerciſes of religion, whiche thinge the fourth commaundement requireth, that he ſubmitte hym ſelfe, and gyue due honour both to the officers, and to all men wyth who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he lyueth, as the fyrſt commaundement requireth, that he conteine hym ſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anger, and all bitter though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, wordes, dedes agaynſt his neighbour, as the ſixt commaundement requireth, that he conteine hym ſelfe from all lecherous lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, and lyue temperatly, as the ſeuenth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement requireth, that he moderate his couetous deſire, and be liberal to al men as the eight commaundement biddeth, that he repreſſe the diſeaſe of backebitynge, and enuiyng an others excellencie, and fauoure the eſtimation, and iuſt prayſes of all men, whither the nynth commaundement calleth vs, although I ſaye, a man thorowe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifit of Chriſt come to thys victory againſt natural vices, &amp; to this great towre of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues (whiche felicitie yet none of the ſayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes euer knowledged to haue chaunced vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym) neuertheles the ſame man by thys
<pb facs="tcp:4169:76" rendition="simple:additions"/> tenth commaundement ſhalbe conuicted, to be a wretche ſtyl, and a damned ſynner, and the enemie of God, and when he hath well loked vpon thys commaundement, he hym ſelfe ſhall bewayle that he is ſuche a one.</p>
               <p>For as longe as he ſhal fynde in hym ſelfe, I ſaye ſome motion of mynde to that, that God forbyddeth, and damneth, but anie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, or prones at all, and a faynt and ſlacke courage to do that, that God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, not only a lothſomnes, and reſiſtence: he ſhall acknowledge him ſelfe to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and condempned by this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a tranſgreſſour of Goddes lawe. For where as the lawe requireth, that no forbydden thynge pleaſe vs, it requireth the ſame to be done of vs wyth all our hert all our ſoule, and all our ſtrength. For the lawe requireth, that God ſhoulde ſo be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and worſhipped of vs. But no man can brynge thys to paſſe, that we be farre from all thoſe thynges that God forbyddeth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte the loue of God, and of thoſe thynges that God commaundeth ſo haue enflamed a man altogyther, that he abhorre from all that, that God forbiddeth, wyth his whole hert, his whole ſoule, and al his ſtrengthes. But none of the ſayntes atteined hereunto, whyle they lyued here. Wherefore it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:4169:77"/> to graunte, that all men are conuicted by thys commaundement, and that no man lyueth in thys worlde whiche in dede is of a cleane herte, and hath no neede to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the curſe, and damnation of the lawe thorowe Chriſte.</p>
               <p>Seynge then that the whole lawe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth hereupon, that we loue God wyth all oure herte. etc. We are conuicted tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours of the whole lawe by thys tenth commaundemente, bycauſe it is proued that we haue not ſatiſfied that poynte of the lawe where vpon the whole lawe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth.</p>
               <p>Therefore by thys commaundemente oure crokedneſſe, and all oure miſerie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyther is mooſte largelye and fullye ſette before oure eyes, and we are mooſte mygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely dryuen to ſeeke repentaunce thereof, and the grace, and ſatiſfaction of oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, whiche turneth awaye the anger, and the curſe of God, deſerued tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe thys in obedience and ſtubburneſſe of oure lyfe, and offreth to the father for vs his obedience, and perfecte ryghtuouſneſſe, and wyth his ſpirite mortifieth oure fleſhe corrupted thorowe concupiſcences, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth vs all togyther, and rayſeth vp in vs a feruent zeale towardes hym ſelfe, and
<pb facs="tcp:4169:77" rendition="simple:additions"/> his commaundementes, that wyth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite we maye conſtantly, and manfullye fyghte agaynſte the fleſhe, and cutte of the lawe of oure members, and kyll the olde A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam dayly more, and more, puttynge on the newe man Ieſus Chriſte, whiche onely hath ſatiſfied the lawe, and is ſo acceptable to the father, that he compteth vs pleaſaunt and acceptable in that dear beloued, though we be euer yet as tranſgreſſours of the law ſo in daunger of his wrath.</p>
               <p>Thys generall ſumme, and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the commaundementes muſte bee mooſte diligentlye repeted, and beaten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the peoples heades, in all ſermons, that they maye both truely acknowledge theyr owne ſynnes, and learne to be repentaunt of them effectuouſlye, and that they maye be myghtelye dryuen to Chriſte the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye leache, and Sauioure of oure ſoules, and alſo that they maye be rayſed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted in him to true vertues, to verie good workes, and to worſhyppynge acceptable vnto God.</p>
               <p>Furthermore the people muſte euer be taughte thys thynge alſo that the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and threates agaynſt the worſhyppyng of falſe Goddes, and Idolatrie pertayne to euerie commaundement.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4169:78"/>
               <p> For the cauſe why they be ioyned to the commaundement that toutcheth falſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is thys, namely for that, that the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng, and tranſgreſſion of the whole law is conteined herein, that we acknowledge, call vpon and worſhippe wyth true fayth, and feare the true God in Chriſte, the Lorde, no departe from hym to falſe Goddes, and to a worſhyppyng ſtraunge from that, that he hym ſelfe taughte.</p>
               <p>For who ſo aſketh euerlaſting health, and all good thinges wholly from God tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe Chriſt Ieſus, and not from anie crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he ſhall alſo endeuour hym ſelfe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to keepe al thoſe thynges, that God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded. For he can not once thinke what better thynge he maye do, as one that beleueth that a bleſſed, and eternall lyfe is preſcribed vnto hym in theſe commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.

<pb facs="tcp:4169:78" rendition="simple:additions"/> of ſome other, then of thys true, and one God, and he hath ſtraung Goddes.

               <p>Secondly the preachers ſhal alſo dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warne thys thynge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this place, (I wyl viſite iniquities. etc.) that al maner of euyls, puniſhementes corporall, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, temporall, and eternall be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therein, amonge whiche thys is the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, when God forſaketh men, when he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his holy ſpirite from them, and giueth them to the deſires of theyr hertes, into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſenſe, into concupiſcences, and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes. etc. Ro. i.

               <p>In thys place the preachers ſhall adde, <note place="margin">God exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs wyth aflictions to call vs backe to repentau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</note> that God when he exerciſeth the fayhthfull wyth ſundrie aflictions, correcteth them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly, and for theyr profitte, and draweth them backe to hym ſelfe, and to his ſonne Chriſte, that they be not damned wyth the wicked worlde, and that he loueth them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge the worſe, whom he puniſheth wyth outwarde puniſhmentes, and ſore calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For he is wonte to begynne his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his owne houſe, and to chaſten them, whom he loueth, and in them to ſhewe to the worlde the vehemencie of his wrath,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:79" rendition="simple:additions"/> that other men beynge frayed wyth theſe iudgementes, and wyth thys ſo greate ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie of God vpon his owne chyldren, ſhoulde forthynke the ſynnes, in which they ſtycke, and amende, and take more diligent hede afterwarde that they ſynne not.</p>
               <p>Thyrdly the people muſt be taught con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernynge thys promiſe and threatenynge of God, I wyll viſite the iniquities of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vpon the chyldren to the thyrde, and fourth generation. etc. that God wyll exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe <note place="margin">Other mens goodnes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth not the vngodlie, nor others vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines hur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth not the godlie.</note> thys reuengeaunce, whiche he threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth here to his diſpicers beinge vngodlie parentes, and elders vpon thoſe chyldren onely, whiche thorowe their owne wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes haue lyke wyſe well deſerued the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhmentes that they ſuffre, ſo that yet in thys worlde they ſuffre muche leſſe, then is due to theyr ſynnes, and peruerſitie.

For to be ſorie for ſynne, ſufficeth not to rightuouſnes before God, though the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe be ſo vehement, that it maye conſume and kyl a man, as there was in Iudas. But ſatiſfaction for ſynnes is alſo required and a ſure truſt of Goddes mercie, wyth a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb facs="tcp:4169:81"/> amendement of lyfe, and a continuall ſtudie of ryghtuouſnes afterwarde.</p>
               <p>But ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perfourme none of theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thorow his owne ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, neither ſatiſfy for his ſynnes committed and reſtore hym ſelfe into the fauour of God, nor embrace a better lyfe afterwarde. Oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſte is alone, whiche thorowe his death hath ſatiſfied for our ſynnes, as Iohn ſayth, he is a propitiation or attonement for oure ſynnes, and not for oure ſynnes onely, but for the ſynnes of the whole worlde.

<pb facs="tcp:4169:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhall be finiſhed, ſynne ſhal take an ende, and euerlaſtynge ryghtuouſneſſe ſhall be brought in.</p>
               <p>As for the Goſpell it is the ioyfull prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng, <note place="margin">What the Goſpel is.</note> and muche wiſhed for, of oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, namely that he came for thys cauſe into the worlde beinge made man, to deliuer all them that beleue in hym from ſynne, death, and eternall damnation, and to gyue them a newe, and perpetuall ryghtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, and lyfe.

So, ſayeth he, it behoued Chriſt to ſuffre, and to ryſe from the dead the thirde daye, and that repentaunce, and remiſſion of ſynnes ſhould be preached in his name among all nations. The Apoſtles taught the ſame thynge eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where, as it appeareth in theyr actes. For thus Petre preacheth, repente your fautes, and let euerie one of you be baptiſed in the name of Ieſus Chriſt for the forgyuenes of ſynnes, and ye ſhall receyue the gyfte of the holy goſte, actes. ij. Item, the God of oure fathers hath rayſed Ieſus, whom ye kylled hangyng vpon wodde, hym God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted wyth his ryght hande a prince and a ſauiour, to gyue repentaunce vnto Iſraell and forgyuenes of ſynnes. etc. And agayne,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:82"/> he commaunded vs that we ſhoulde preach to the people, and teſtifie that it is he, which was appointed of god a iudge of the quicke and the deade. To hym all the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes beare wytnes, that who ſo beleueth in hym, he ſhall receyue remiſſion of ſynnes thorowe his name. Saynt Paule preacheth the ſame thynge actes. xiij. Be it knowen to you then bretherne that thorowe thys man remiſſion of ſynnes is preached. etc.</p>
               <p>Though thys preachyng of the Goſpell be ſhort, neuertheles it is the power of God vnto ſaluation to euerie one that beleueth, Ro. i. Wherfore Chriſte alſo compareth the Goſpell to a muſtarde corne, to a treaſure hidde in a felde, to a precious margarite, for the gettyng wherof we muſt ſell, and leaue all thynges. Math. xiiij.</p>
               <p>But that the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, and efficacie of the Goſpel may be more euident, the preachers muſte euer ſtudiouſly ſet forth Chriſte, and religiouſly preache howe great thynges he ſuffered for our ſaluation, howe great thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he did. Further howe he wil haue theſe thynges ſhewed vnto vs, and what he wyll worke in vs thorowe thys preaching.</p>
               <p>It is euident thorow the preachyng of the lawe, that all we be ſynners of oure ſelues, and deſtitute of the glorie of God. Rom. iij.
<pb facs="tcp:4169:82" rendition="simple:additions"/> Item that we are deade thorowe miſdedes, and ſynnes, and be by nature the children of wrath, as other be. Epheſi. ij. priſoners, and ſolde vnder ſynne, that we oure ſelues can not ryſe out of thys perdition of oure owne ſtrengthe. Roma. viij</p>
               <p>Wherfore to obtaine ſaluation there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a mediatour, and ſauiour, whiche might pacifie God beinge angrie, and reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cile vs to God, and deliuer vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſynne, and death and make vs heyres of euerlaſtynge lyfe.</p>

               <p>Thys Mediatour firſt entreateth wyth God the father thorowe his lyfe, death, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and interceſſion, to turne his wrath fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, to receyue vs into fauour, and to gyue to vs, as to his children the holy ſpirite, and euerlaſtyng lyfe.</p>
               <p>Further he cometh to vs and handleth his matter with vs thorowe the miſterie of the Goſpell, his holy ſpirite, and the croſſe, that we maye beleue hym, and thorow faith obtayne ryghtuouſnes, and euerlaſting life.</p>
               <p>And he handleth his matter wyth God after thys ſorte, firſte he ordred his whole
<pb facs="tcp:4169:83"/> lyfe accordyng to the wyl of the father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge made obedient vnto hym vnto death, whiche thynges we ſhould haue done. But bicauſe he ſawe that they were impoſſible vnto vs, he perfourmed them hym ſelfe he fulfylled the lawe, as he ſayth in Mathew. I came not to deſtroye the lawe, but to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyll it. And Paule to the Gala. iiij. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fulnes of tyme came, God ſent forth his ſonne made of a woman, made ſubiecte to the lawe, to redeame them that were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte to the lawe. Therfore he wrate alſo to the Cor. Chriſte is made rightuouſnes vnto vs of God, that is to ſaye, his rightuouſnes was perfourmed for our ſakes, and gyuen vnto vs. Item Phil. iij. Yea and I thynke all thinges to be loſſe for the excellencie of the knowledge of Chriſte my Lorde, and I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt them for refuſe, that I maye wynne Chriſte and be founde in hym, not hauing my righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſnes of the lawe, but that, that is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the fayth of Chriſte. etc. For whoſo beleueth in Chriſt, to him whole Chriſt, and his perfecte ryghtuouſneſſe is imputed at once, and togyther.</p>
               <p>Secondly Chriſte tranſlateth and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all our ſynnes vpon him ſelfe, dieth for them, and ſuffreth al thoſe thinges that we ſhould haue ſuffred for our ſinnes. As Iohn
<pb facs="tcp:4169:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> Baptiſte teſtifieth, Beholde the lambe of God, whiche taketh awaye the ſynnes of the worlde. Item Eſaie, of a truth he bare our diſeaſes, and he ſuſteyned our ſorowes, and we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted hym ſtricken wyth a plage, and depreſſed of God. But he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for oure iniquities, and beaten for oure ſynnes, the chaſteninge of peace was vpon hym, and we were healed wyth his ſtripes. And we haue ſtrayed lyke ſheepe, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into his owne way, and God hath putte v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him the iniquities of al vs. Item Paule Rom. viij. God ſpared not his owne ſonne, but gaue him for vs all, and Chap. iiij. He was deliuered for oure ſynnes, and rayſed for our iuſtification. So Gala. iij. Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deamed vs from the curſe of the lawe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge made a curſe for vs, for it is wrytten, curſed is euerie one that hangeth on tree.</p>
               <p>Thirdly he is a mediatour for vs, that God wyll receyue vs into fauoure. Eſaie. liij. He bare the ſynnes of manie, and prayed for tranſgreſſours. The prayer of Chriſte Iohn. xvij. teacheth the ſame thynge, I praye for them, not for the worlde, but for thoſe whome thou haſt gyuen me, keepe them in thy name. etc. And Paule Ro. viij. Chriſte is at the right hande of the father, and maketh interceſſion for vs. Ite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Hebr. v. whiche
<pb facs="tcp:4169:84"/> in the dayes of his fleſhe, when he had offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp with ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge criyng, and teares, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſupplications before him, that was able to deliuer him. etc. Yea the whole epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſheweth thys thinge mooſte euidently, that Chriſte oure high biſhoppe offred hym ſelfe for our ſinnes, and entred into the moſt holie place wyth his owne bloude, an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtyng redemption beinge founde out. So then Chriſte handled, and doeth handle the matter for vs thorowe his death, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhewed to the father, and thorowe his interceſſion, that he reconcileth vs to God the father, and for thys cauſe he is made Lorde ouer all thynges, as the Apoſtle wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth Pſal. ij. whiche beinge in the fourme of God thought it no robberie to be equall wyth God, but he emptied him ſelfe taking the fourme of a ſeruaunt, conſtituted in the lykenes of men, and in ſhape founde as a man, he humbled him ſelfe, made obedient vnto the death, and that of the croſſe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore God rayſed him vp vnto ſupreme high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, and gaue hym a name aboue al names, that in the name of Ieſus all knees ſhoulde bowe. etc.</p>
               <p>After that Chriſt hath thus handled our matter before the father, and pleaſed his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, afterwarde he executeth the office of a
<pb facs="tcp:4169:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> faithful interceſſour and patrone, he turneth him ſelf to vs, he entreateth vs, that he may heale oure ſynnes, and weaknes. For thys cauſe he ſayed to his diſciples. All power in heauen, and in earth is gyuen vnto me, go therfore, and teache al nations, and receyue them into my diſcipline, preache the Goſpel to euerie creature, baptiſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the name of the father, and of the ſonne, and of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie goſte, he that beleueth, and is baptiſed, ſhalbe ſaued, and he that beleueth not, ſhalbe damned. And teache them to keepe all thoſe thinges that I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded you. Thus thorowe thys ſhorte, and ſimple preachinge of the Goſpell, he executeth the buſines of oure iuſtification after a merueylous ſorte. Therfore as the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, and vſe of the law muſte be declared to the people, ſo the vſe, and vertue of the Goſpell muſte be propou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and beaten in wyth ſinguler diligence. For it is the power of God vnto ſaluation to euerie one that beleueth. Ro. i.</p>
               <p>Firſt then the preachers ſhall teache, that the Goſpell bringeth to vs remiſſion of ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, if we beleue it truely, and vnfaynedly, and determine thorow this fayth, that God for his ſonnes ſake wyll be mercifull vnto vs, and accepte vs, and compt vs for ſonnes not for the dignitie of our workes, and they

Iuſtified of fayth, we haue peace towardes God thorowe oure Lorde Chriſte Ieſus. Ephe. ij. he is our peace. etc. Eſaie. lij. Ro. x. howe beautiful are the feete of them that preach peace. etc. For where the voice of the Goſpel ſoundeth not, oure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences can haue no peace, as Dauid wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth Pſal. xxxvij. There is no whole part in my bodie by reaſon of thy wrath, neither is there peace in my bones bycauſe of my ſynne. etc.</p>
               <p>Secondly the Goſpell bryngeth to vs the ryghtuouſnes of Chriſte, in whiche we maye truſt, as done for vs, and gyuen vnto vs, aſwell as, if we had perfourmed it oure ſelues. For ſo Paule ſayeth. i. Cor. i. Chriſte Ieſus is made vnto vs of God, wyſedome, ryghtuouſnes, ſanctification, and redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Philip. iij. That I may be founde in hym not hauynge my ryghtuouſnes of the lawe, but that, that is thorowe the fayth of Ieſus Chriſt, etc. For thys is a perfect, true,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> and euerlaſtyng rightuouſnes. For our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues be farre from that ryghtuouſnes, and perfection of lyfe, whiche the lawe of God requireth. And beſydes that, verie manie ſynnes abyde euer in vs, and wonderfull weaknes, as Eſaie ſayeth. lxiij. all we are as one defiled, and all oure ryghtuouſnes as a garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of beggerlie patches. And the Pſal. O Lorde entre not into iudgemente wyth me. etc. which ſentence, teacheth merueilous playnelye, that we can not ſette oure wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines agaynſte the iudgement of God.</p>
               <p>Wherfore if our ſaluation ſhall be certayne vnto vs, it muſt leaue vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome other righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſnes, and that a perfecte rightuouſnes, namely vpon the ryghtuouſnes of Chriſte, as Paule wytneſſeth Ro. viij. God hath not ſpared his owne ſonne. etc.</p>
               <p>Therefore oure Iuſtification, and oure rightuouſnes before God, which. S. Paule and all the other Apoſtles teache, conſiſteth in two thinges, in forgiuenes of ſynnes, and gyuynge of the rightuouſnes of Chriſt tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe fayeth. And thys onely is a ſure, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, and perpetuall ryghtuouſnes, which Chriſt hath caryed vp into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with him ſelfe, to the ryght hande of God, where no man can oppreſſe it or ouerthrowe it, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable daungers fal vpon our ryghtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes
<pb facs="tcp:4169:87"/> dayly. Therefore our lyfe is ſayed to be hidden wyth Chriſte in God. Col. iij. And ſeing that we glorie of thys our Lorde and ſauiour, and his rightuouſnes, our lyfe is in the heauens. Philip. iij. For where our treaſure is, there is our herte.</p>
               <p>Wherfore the ryghtuouſnes of God gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to vs in Chriſte, muſt be diligently, and continually beaten into the people by the preachers, and they muſte take verie good hede that the knowledge, and truſte thereof be not corrupted, and that men ſlyde not backe agayne to the confidence of mannes ryghtuouſnes.</p>
               <p>For though that true fayth in Chriſt, be neuer wythout good workes, and loue, yet workes deſerue not remiſſion of ſynnes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a man acceptable to God for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, but for Chriſtes ſake, whyle he embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, and holdeth by fayth his rightuouſnes and redemption gyuen vnto hym.</p>
               <p>Thirdly when a mynde affrayed wyth the feelyng of Goddes wrath, ſuſteyneth it ſelfe wyth the voice of the Goſpel, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the knowledge of the ſauiour Chriſt, and promiſes of God, whiche Chriſte ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth vnto vs, the holie ſpirite is preſent and worketh in our hertes, a ſure truſte of Goddes beniuolence, and adoption of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtyng
<pb facs="tcp:4169:87" rendition="simple:additions"/> lyfe. For in hearinge of the Goſpel the holie ſpirite is gyuen, as Paule wytneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, Gala. iij. Thys one thinge I deſire to learne of you, receiued ye the ſpirite thorow the dedes of the lawe, or thorowe the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of fayth. Item. iiij. Bicauſe ye be chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, God hath ſent forth the ſpirite of his ſonne. etc. And Iohn. vij. he that beleueth in me, as the ſcripture ſayeth, fluddes of lyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, water ſhall flowe out of his bealy, thys thynge (ſayeth Iohn) he ſpake of the ſpirite, whom they ſhoulde receyue, that beleued in hym. And thorowe thys receyuynge of the holie gooſte, a newe generation is cauſed, whereof Iohn ſpeaketh. i. Chap. As many as receyued him, he gaue them power to be the ſonnes of God, them I ſay that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued in his name, whiche were not borne of bloud, nor of the wyll of man, but of God, Item Ro. vij. who ſo euer be ledde wyth the ſpirite of God, they be the children of God. And. ii. Cor. iii. we repreſenting the glorie of the Lorde in a glaſſe wyth a ryght face, are tranſfigured to the ſame Image from glory to glorie, as of the ſpirite of the Lorde, that is to ſaye, when we receyue thorow fayeth the exedinge mercie of God promiſed, and exhibited in Chriſte, the holy goſte worketh in vs a newe lyfe, and a newe knowledge of
<pb facs="tcp:4169:88"/> God vnknowen to mannes reaſon.</p>
               <p>Moreouer thys fayth, thys knowledge of God in Chriſt, and aſſenting to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, thorowe the worke of the ſame holie ſpirite, the ſpirite of adoption, kendleth, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteyneth, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerueth, and encreaſeth ſuch loue of God, ſuche deſire to gratifie, and to ſerue God, and to approue our ſelues to hym in all thynges, to glorifie hym, that wyth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great diligence, and carefulnes we keepe our ſelues from al ſynne, and moſte earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applie oure ſelues to all good workes. The holy ſcriptures deſcribe euerie where thys nature, thys ſtrength of a newe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Chriſte, and of a man borne agayne, thys ordre, and conſequentie, or rather lync<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge togyther of the workes of the holie gooſte in the beleuynge. Whiche places the preachers muſte often wyth ſinguler dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence propoune, faythfully declare, and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinually beate into the people.</p>
               <p>Of whiche places theſe be ſome, Ro. viii. But ye be not in the fleſhe, but in the ſpirite for the ſpirite of God dwelleth in you. And if anie man haue not the ſpirite of Chriſte, the ſame is not his. Nowe if Chriſte be in you, the bodie is dead concerning ſynne, but the ſpirite is life co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Iuſtification. etc. Wherefore bretherne we are detters not to

But if ye mortifie the dedes of the fleſhe with the ſpirite, ye ſhall lyue. For as manie as ſhal be ledde wyth the ſpirite of God, be the chyldren of God. etc. ii. Cor. v. Iudgyng thys that if one died for all, then all were dead, and he dyed for all, that they, whiche lyue after thys, myght not lyue to them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, but to hym, that died for them, and roſe againe. etc. Gala. v. walke in the ſpirite, and ye ſhall not perfourme the concupiſcence of the fleſhe. Item, but the fruite of the ſpirite is charitie, ioye, peace. etc. Ephe. v. Ye were ſometyme darkenes, but nowe lyghte in the Lorde, walke as the chyldren of lyghte. etc. Item, Se then that ye walke circumſpectly, not as vnwyſe, but as wyſe, redeamyng oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, bicauſe the dayes be euyl. etc. Phil i. Thys I praye that your loue may abounde more and more, in knowledge, and all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandynge, that ye may allowe the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that be ryghte good, that ye be ſincere etc. Collo. iii. putte on then, as the choſen of God, holie, and beloued the bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, gentlenes, ſobrenes. etc. Tit. ii. Ieſus Chriſt gaue hym ſelfe for vs for to redeame vs from all iniquitie, and to purifie vs to hym ſelfe a peculiar people, a folower of

Euerie one that hath thys hope in hym, purifieth hym ſelfe, as he is pure, all that committe ſynne, the ſame committe iniquitie, and ſynne is iniquitie. And ye know that he appeared to take awaye ſynnes. etc.</p>
               <p>Theſe places, and ſuche other, in whiche the nature of regeneration, and of a newe creature, and the ordre, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence, or rather the knittyng of the workes of the holy goſt, be declared, the preachers muſt often recite, faythfully expoune, and printe into the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in theyr ſermons, that they maye learne thorowly, and euer diligently reuolue in theyr myndes, that they whiche be borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne in Chriſt, and grafted in him, and be made fruitefull braunches in thys lyfe, and good trees, muſte alſo brynge forth good fruites, and foraſmuche as they be a newe, and diuine creation, made vnto good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, they muſte trauayle alſo in newe, and diuine workes, whiche God hath prepared in them wyth his commaundement, calling and gifte, and worketh co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually wyth his
<pb facs="tcp:4169:89" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſpirite, to his owne glorie, and to the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and repayryng of our neighbours.</p>
               <p>But alwayes, and before al thinges they muſte be taught moſte diligently, that a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience fearfull by reaſon of hir ſynnes, and the wrath of God, muſte comforte hyr ſelfe wyth the voice of the Goſpell, and certifie hyr ſelfe therby, that God wyll ſurely gyue his holie ſpirite, whyle we praye for it in thys diſtreſſe, and that thys petition is a true, and principall worſhyppyng of God, which god chiefly requireth of vs. And this high worſhyppyng of God, muſte be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned onely wyth the exerciſe of true fayeth, wherof the blinde men of this world know nothynge, putting theyr ryghtuouſnes, and holines, in outwarde ceremonies, and truſte of theyr owne rightuouſnes. But when the herte wraſtleth wyth the feelynge of the wrath of God, and lyuely knowledge of ſynnes, and comforteth hyr ſelfe with fayth in Chriſte the mediatoure, in thys caſe, that ſweete word of Eſaie is vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, which is the place of my reſte, ſayeth the Lorde, I wyll loke vpon the humble, and broken in ſpirite, and tremblynge at my worde. For then the Lorde dwelleth in vs in dede, when we flee to Chriſte the mediatour, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine wyth our ſelues, that for his ſake we
<pb facs="tcp:4169:90"/> be accepted and hearde of the heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made heyres of euerlaſtyng lyfe.</p>
               <p>Wherfore the true fayth of the Goſpel, whereof we ſpeake in this place, ſignifieth not onely the knowledge of the ſtorie, as in Iames, when he ſayeth, the deuylles beleue, but it ſignifieth that knowledge of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and aſſentyng cauſed thorowe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Chriſte, whereby there ſpryngeth in our hertes a ſure truſte of Goddes beniuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and adoption, thorow which we haue affiau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that God is mercifull vnto vs, and hath made vs heyres of euerlaſting lyfe for his ſonnes ſake, whiche fayth excludeth all truſt of our owne ryghtuouſnes, and all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour concernyng God, &amp; his wyl towardes vs. For thys fayth comprehendeth a ſincere and perfecte vnderſtandinge of all the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our religion, and an aſſent therunto. Therfore thys pure doctrine of the Goſpel muſte be reteyned of fearfull conſciences, that they maye knowe, that they obteyne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſynnes frely for Chriſtes ſake by fayth, and not by the deſeruyng of workes. And let them beware that they remoue not thys glorie of the Mediatour Chriſte vnto mennes workes. For if the promiſe of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation dyd hange vpon our worthines, the conſcience ſhoulde remayne vncertaine, ſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
<pb facs="tcp:4169:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> in perpetuall doubte, and ſhoulde flee from God. For we can not ſatiſfie the lawe of God at all, and many ſinnes cleaue euer in vs, and there remayneth great weaknes. Neither could the hert call certaynely vpon God, if oure owne deſeruynges were to be brought forth, for it ſhould be frayed awaye perceyuing him ſelfe to be deſtitute of thoſe merites, that God requireth. Therefore we muſte come vnto God wyth thys fayeth, wherby we beleue that we are accepted and iuſtified before God for Chriſtes ſake, and not for our merites. Thys fundation muſte be layed fyrſte of al, wherby we be planted in Chriſt, and diſſeuered from all vngodlie men, and aliauntes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſte. Afterwarde it is neceſſarie to enſtruct the people a right of good workes, chiefely after thys ſorte.</p>

                  <p>Secondly that it is requiſite that a newe lyfe folowe, and obedience towardes God, though it be vnperfecte, and though muche weakenes, and manie vices remayne in vs. Wherfore we muſte reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre that it is euer needfull to aſke forgyuenes of ſynnes. As Chriſte taught vs all to praye to the father. Forgyue vs our dettes. For no man vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth ſufficiently, howe greate the anger of God is agaynſte ſynne, oure reconciler Chriſt dyd onely fully perceyue it, when he ſayed. If they do thys in the grene wood what wyl they do in the drye? we muſte not
<pb facs="tcp:4169:93" rendition="simple:additions"/> then extenuate, and diminiſhe ſynne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly though thys obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be weake yet we muſt determine, that it pleaſeth God in the reconciled for his ſonne ſake, as ſaynt Petre exhorteth to offre ſpirituall ſacrifices, acceptable vnto God thorow Ieſus Chriſt as if he woulde ſay not for their owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, but for the Mediatours ſake Chriſt our only high biſhoppe euer makyng inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for vs.</p>
                  <p>Thys is it that is wonte to be ſayed at other tymes, that good workes oughte to be done out of fayth, that is, that a man ſhould not wauer, doubtynge whether his lyfe or workes pleaſe God, but certayne determine that he is acceptable to God for Chriſtes ſake, as we haue often ſayed, and therefore that his workes, being commaunded by the worde of God, be acceptable vnto God for the ſame Chriſtes ſake, thoughe they be weake, and vnperfecte.</p>
                  <p>Therfore faith muſt be exerciſed in good workes two wayes. Firſte that we beleue they pleaſe God. Secondly that we praye to God, that for Chriſtes ſake, he wil healp vs both to lyue godlie, and alſo to do thoſe workes, that ſhall profitte the common lyfe of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that he wyll giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good ſucceſſe.</p>
                  <p>Nowe let euerie man conſidre wyth him
<pb facs="tcp:4169:94"/> ſelfe, howe greate thys mercie of God is, and howe ſweete thys doctrine is. It ſemeth a ſmall worke when the mother bryngeth vp hyr childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, gyueth ſucke, waſheth them, and doth other thinges pertainyng to nure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and when ſhe enſtructeh them vnto the inuocation of God, and religion. But the chiefeſt worſhipping of God reſteth in theſe poyntes, if they be done in fayth, that is, if the mother truſte, that ſhe is acceptable to God for Chriſtes ſake, and beleue that hyr doinges pleaſe God for the ſame mans ſake if ſhe call for healpe of God to the perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunce of thoſe thynges that he wyll proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per them, and make them holeſome, finally that he wyll keepe, and nouriſhe vp hir in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, and gouerne his lyfe in all thynges.</p>
                  <p>After thys ſorte our fayth muſte be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in al other buſines, and offices of thys lyfe. Magiſtrates, and wariars be exerciſed wyth ſundrie daungers, troubles, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. Neuertheles if they execute their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice after thys maner, and wyth ſuche fayth as we haue ſpoken of, all ſuche thynges be worſhippinges of God. Thys is no ſmall conſolation to a godlie mynde. And it is the true, &amp; propre doctrine of the Goſpel, which Adam, Noe, Abraham, Iacob, Ioſeph, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, Dauid, and Paule taught.</p>

                  <p>Firſte becauſe God hath commaunded them. Al creatures ſerue God, and be made to the obedience of God. It is euident then, that ſeinge that man ought to ſhewe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto God, Goddes commaundement is the fyrſt &amp; chiefeſt cauſe, why we ſhoulde do good workes. And in as muche as God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded good workes, it foloweth of the ſame cauſe, that they that exerciſe not them ſelues in wel working, but continue in the contempt of Goddes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manndementes, deſerue euerlaſtynge paynes. Howe be it God puniſheth ſinnes in this lyfe alſo with infinite miſeries. Thys the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is an other cauſe whiche oughte to ſteare vp our myndes to worke well, that we fal not into euerlaſting paynes. For ſo Paule ſayeth. i. Corhin. vi. Erre not. Neither adulterers, nor worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Images. etc. ſhall poſſeſſe the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. And Gala. v. They whiche do ſuche thynges ſhall not poſſeſſe the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</p>
                  <p>The thyrde cauſe of doing good workes is verie neceſſarie for that, that it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that a true fayth, and a certayne truſte in Chriſte can ſtande wythout perfecte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion
<pb facs="tcp:4169:95"/> vnto God, or wyth ſynnes, whiche are committed agaynſt a mannes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience. Theſe thynges appeare playnly by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie nature of fayth. For fayth is that aſſent to the Goſpell, out of whiche there aryſeth a ſure confidence of Goddes mercie promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for Chriſtes ſake. But ſuche a truſt can not ſtande with a purpoſe of ſinning, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is a manifeſt comtempte of God, and an vndoubted prouocation of Goddes wrath.</p>
                  <p>By reaſon of thys fyghtynge betwene fayth, and ſynne, Paule ſayed, that what ſo euer is not of fayeth, is ſynne, ſignifiynge that the nature of fayth is ſuche, that it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth good fruites of it ſelfe. Wherfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinneth, as that is done by wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge confidence, ſo the truſte in Chriſte is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, and grace, and eternall lyfe is caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye and mannes ſaluation is paſte reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, excepte he recouer a truſt in Chriſte, and puttynge awaye all wronge affiaunce, he wholly reſtore hym ſelfe into the obedience of God.</p>
                  <p>The large promiſes of Goddes reward miniſtre the forth cauſe of good workes. For it is the commaundement of God, that his moſte ample promiſes ſhoulde be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to all men. As Paule ſayeth, Godlines
<pb facs="tcp:4169:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> is profitable vnto all thynges, and hath a promiſe of the preſent lyfe, and of the lyfe to come. And we ſhewed before that euyll workes be puniſhed wyth euerlaſtyng pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whiche yet often tymes haue their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnynge in thys lyfe, as it apppeareth in Saul, Achab, Iuda. So contrarie wiſe God requireth their workes, that repent wyth eternall rewardes. Howe be it thys funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſaluation ſtandeth ſtyll, that is to ſay, the truſt of euerlaſting lyfe in Chriſt the Lorde, whereof we ſpake before, namely that we obtaine remiſſion of ſynnes, &amp; euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtyng lyfe thorow fayth for Chriſtes ſake and not for the worthines of our workes. For thys ſentence ſtandeth faſt and ſure, in which the Lorde teſtifieth of him ſelfe. Iho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. vi. Thys is the wyll of the father, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one, that beleueth in the ſonne, ſhall haue eternall lyfe.</p>
                  <p>For though God thorowe a merueilous purpoſe ſuffre his churche to be preſſed gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly with the croſſe, and exerciſeth it with great miſeries, as ſhalbe ſayed hereafter, yet foraſmuche as he wyll be knowen to men in thys lyfe, and be magnified, he ſteareth vp, preſerueth, and defendeth the preachers of his name, the teachers of his Goſpell, and alſo the hearers, as he promiſed that his
<pb facs="tcp:4169:96"/> churche ſhoulde continue here vnto the ende of the worlde. Therfore for thys purpoſe, that his church maye continue perpetually, he dealeth forth ſundrie giftes of his ſpirite, and he gyueth to his ſayntes that thorowe good workes they deſerue the encreaſe of vertues, accordynge to the worde of Chriſt, there ſhalbe gyuen to him that hath. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge that in thys life we haue neede of fode, peace, lawfull gouernaunce of the common weale, health. etc. God addeth theſe thynges alſo, and recompenſeth the good workes of his therwyth, &amp; yet with thys moderation, that neuertheles he holdeth ſtyll his churche vndre the croſſe. Of thys rewarde of good workes Chriſte ſpeaketh. Gyue, and there it ſhal be gyuen vnto you. And Eſaie. xxxiij. He that walketh in ryghtuouſnes. etc. ſhall dwell in an high, and therfore a ſure place. He ſhall not wante meate and drynke, his eyes ſhall ſe the kynge in his glorie. So though Eſaie, Hieremie, Daniel, and Paule were preſſed wyth ſundrie, and moſte gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous aflictions, yet God after a meruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous forte preſerued them a greate whyle in lyfe, and miniſtred vnto them abundauntly thynges neceſſarie for lyfe. And ſurely for thys cauſe God promiſed vs corporall goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, that being ſteared vp thorowe ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:96" rendition="simple:additions"/> we ſhoulde exerciſe fayth, and inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and laboure the more to be buſie in good workes. When thou heareſt then, that God commaundeth the to gyue almes, and addeth his promiſes, that he wyll gyue the agayne fode, and other good thinges. Giue thyne almes liberally, and exerciſe thy faith therin, and confirme thy mynde, that it is God, that gyueth the corne, a lyuynge, and all good thinges, that maynteyneth the, and thyne, and that he wyll recompence thy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie ſhewed for his ſake. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou conſidereſt theſe thynges wyth fayeth, and haſt afterwarde confirmed thys ſentence of fayth in thy mynde, thou muſte exerciſe alſo the inuocation of God, and truſtynge in his promiſes, thou muſte praye hym thorowe Chriſte his ſonne, that as he hath promiſed, he wyll gyue the thynges neceſſarie for life, and maynteyne the, and thyne, and thou muſte alſo wyth a ſure hope loke for thoſe thynges, whiche thou haſte ſo prayed for of hym, nothynge doubtynge but that he wyl gyue them to the, as farre as they maye be good for the in dede.</p>
                  <p>For if the mynde be ſo farre from God, and ſo emptie of the truſte of his goodnes, that it can not ſo muche as aſke, hope and loke for corporall goodes from him, neither
<pb facs="tcp:4169:97"/> exerciſe fayeth in aſkynge, and lokynge for thoſe thinges from him, ſuche a mynde ſhal feele muche leſſe of deſire, and hope of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and euerlaſtynge goodes.</p>
                  <p>Such cauſes then of good workes muſt be driuen into men diligently, that they may be ſteared vp to worke well, and to auoyed euyll workes. Neither haue we neede of a ſmall fyght in thys caſe, that we beware of euyll workes, and trauayle conſtantly in good workes. For the weaknes of nature doeth not onely prouoke vs to euyl workes but the deuyll layeth in awayte for vs, to dryue vs thereunto wyth merueylous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes, as S. Petre ſayeth that the deuyll goeth about roarynge lyke a Lion, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng whom ue maye deuoure. And though theſe thynges ſeame foliſhe to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that lacke the feare of God, which folowe theyr luſtes without care, yet we haue experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exemples, that verie manie men are miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably driuen of the deuyl into horrible miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheuous actes, and ſo into temporall, and euerlaſtyng puniſhmentes. For howe many doeth he ſende headlyng into Idolatrie, and moſte pernitious errours concernynge reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? How manie driueth he to vniuſt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?

For howe greate, and howe horrible ſynnes folowed of the adulterie of Dauid. No ſinne is alone, there cleaue alwayes to one verie manie other. Wherfore the healpe of God muſte be called for continually, and wyth moſte feruent wiſhes, and we our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues muſte lyue in feare, and continuall care, whiche thynge the Apoſtle cammaundeth, Philippi. ij. worke your owne health wyth feare, and tremblyng.</p>

Out of thys fayeth there ſpryngeth neceſſarely a true confidence in Chriſte, a loue of God, and a deſire to lyue after his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.

               <p>Therfore the miniſters, as we haue ſayd muſt diligently teache the people, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they entreate of iuſtifiynge and ſauynge fayth, that thys lyuely, and workyng fayth is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanded, whiche we defined a litle before and not ſuche a fayth, as maye be wythout the loue of God, and wythout good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.

<pb facs="tcp:4169:101"/> they haue perſecuted me, they wil perſecute you alſo. etc. And that they wyll perſecute a godly life. S. Paul teacheth. ij. Tim. iij. As manie as wyll lyue godlie in Chriſte ſhall ſuffre perſecution.</p>
               <p>It is then ryghte neceſſarie that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the worde, teache, comforte, and ſtrengthen the people wyth all faythfulnes and diligence to beare the croſſe, &amp; to learne to ouercome aduerſities wyth patience.</p>
               <p>For we maye heare euerie where the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlie, and blaſphemous wordes of men that be in aflictions. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to arme theyr mynde with patience, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that aflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are ſent of God, agaynſt that, they crie ſtreyght waye, that they are not ſent of God, but of Satan, and if thou wylte ſaye ſtyll that God chaſtiſeth them, whom he loueth, they ſaye, they wiſhe that he woulde not loue them ſo muche. When anie incommoditie, or aduerſitie chaunceth to them vnloked for, the cauſe whereof they can not attayne wyth theyr foliſhe reaſon, forthwyth they aſcribe it to arte magike. Whiche errour, and ſuperſtition is chiefely in vplandiſhe men, and other rude felowes. Thorowe whiche errour it cometh to paſſe that when they fall into anie calamitie, they runne ſtreyght waies to wiſardes, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:101"/> they aſke counſell of them, and beleue their lyes, and for the moſte parte burthen them wyth iniuſte ſuſpicions, and falſely ſclaunder them, that be innocent. Further alſo they embrace their enchauntme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and magike remedies, vſing the ayde of deuyls, which is an horrible defectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the true God, and a deniyng of him, whiche ſurely be great, and heynous ſynnes, for reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce wherof the wrath of God, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt puniſhmentes are wonte to come vpon the vnfaythfull, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth. Therfore that we maye reſiſt ſo great wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, and abhomination, and that men maye be broughte to haue true patience in the croſſe, the preachers muſte teache ſome what after thys ſorte of the croſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, though the deuyll wyth his garde burne wyth an incredible hatred agaynſte the godlie, and deſireth excedingly to hurte them by all meanes, and in what thynge ſo euer he can, in bodie, ſoule, goodes, fame, as Petre teſtifieth, ſayinge the deuill walketh about. etc. Neuertheles this is certaine, that he can not once moue an heare of our heade, excepte God ſuffre hym ſo to do, as Chriſte ſayth. Math. x. Are not two ſparowes ſolde for a farthynge, and one of them falleth not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth wythout your father. And the
<pb facs="tcp:4169:102"/> verie heares of your heade are al numbred. The ſtorie of Iob witneſſeth the ſame, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Satan coulde not hurte, but by the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God, neither in goodes, nor bodie. For we are enuironned wyth manie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes of Angels, which haue charge of vs, as the prophete Eliſeus ſayeth to his ladde, iiij. of kynges. vi. When the kynge of Siria commaunded the prophete to be taken. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid in the Pſalm. xxxiij. wytneſſeth that the ſame is gyuen not onely to Eliſeus, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to all the godlie ſayinge. They that feare the Lorde, he compaſſeth them aboute, as it were with pauilions, and the watching An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell keepeth them ſafe But where tentes be pitched, there the holieſt muſte needes be preſent. So Chriſte hym ſelfe ſayeth alſo of the yonge children. Their angels ſe alwaies the face of my father, whiche is in heauen.</p>
               <p>We maye dayly ſe and feele thys defence, garde, and cuſtodie of the Angels, if we wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turne oure myndes to the workes of God, and conſidre them wyth the eyes of fayth. For how many new enginnes deuiſeth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan daily: What miſchiues inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth he tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe wicked men, wherewyth he yet profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothyng, ſo that we muſt needes grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that God diſapoynteth thoſe deuiſes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tan, and not anie wiſedome of man. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:4169:102" rendition="simple:additions"/> men muſte be taughte diligently that what ſo euer good or euyll chaunce to them (ſynne onely excepted) they beleue it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to them from God, and his prouidence though it be done by the miniſterie of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and of the vngodly.</p>
               <p>Secondly foraſmuche as it is well kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen that aduerſitie cometh not by chaunce, but by the permiſſion, and determined pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God, we oughte not to doubte, but that it chaunceth to vs for good, and that ſuche thynges be as ſignes of Goddes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuolence, and not of his wrath, as the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Hebrues teacheth. xij. My ſonne neglecte not the correction of God, nor faint thou when thou arte rebuked of hym, for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lorde loueth, him he correcteth. etc. S. Paule ſayeth the ſame thynge. i. Cor. xi. When we are chaſtiſed, we are corrected of the Lorde, that we be not condemned wyth thys worlde. Item Ro. viij. We knowe that to them that loue God, all thynges worke for good, to them I ſaye, whiche be called ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cording to his determined will.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they muſte be taughte that the croſſe, and aflictions be a ſchole, wherein we are wel nourtured, and enſtructed of the wil of God. For Chriſte ſayeth, Luke. xiiij. He that beareth not his croſſe, and foloweth me
<pb facs="tcp:4169:103"/> can not be my diſciple. For we ought not to acknowledge an other maiſter vpon earth. If then we can not be his diſciples, excepte we take our croſſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, we can not learne of hym the thynges that pertayne to oure ſaluation, wythout the croſſe, and afliction. Wherefore S. Paule exhorteth vs alſo Ro. xij. to gyue our bodies a lyuely ſacrifice, to be killed with the croſſe, and that we ſhould trie what the good wyl of God is. etc. For we learne manie thynges vnder the croſſe, and aflictions, which it ſkylleth vs to know vnto our ſaluation. Of al whiche neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les the ſumme, and ende is, to acknowledge the good and fatherly wil of God towarde vs. But we wyll reherſe ſome of theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Some vndre the croſſe acknowledge their weaknes, and ſinnes, which otherwiſe they would not haue founde in them ſelues, as Iob. For when he had a while keept and ſhewed patience vnto God, at the laſt being broken, and ouercome wyth the moſte gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous calamities, wherewith the Lorde exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed hym, he curſſed the daye of his natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and murmured agaynſte God, whiche faute he would neuer haue thought to haue bene in hym, wythout the croſſe.</p>
               <p>In the croſſe then, we feele, how much euil hangeth yet in vs, the ſecrete vices of oure
<pb facs="tcp:4169:103" rendition="simple:additions"/> herte, and naughtie concupiſcence of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is brought forth, and diſcloſed vnto vs. Wherfore they whiche are impatient in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, whiche be diſcouraged, or moued wyth ſome kynde of reuengynge, or flee to euyll craftes, and remedies of deuyls, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the confeſſion of the name of Chriſte ſhoulde backe, and abiure the Goſpel, or do ſome thynge vngodlie, and vnworthie of chriſtian profeſſion, ſuche men maye learne thorowe theyr fall, that they do not yet tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleue God. For ſuch falles are vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fruites of infidelitie, and thei proue thoſe men, whiche ſo fall to diſtruſte God, and to deſpeyre of his gooddes, &amp; healpe, and that they truſte in them ſelues, and in other cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures, yea in witchcraftes, and moreouer in the deuyl hym ſelfe. They then whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge tried wyth the croſſe fynde that there hangeth in them greate wickednes, whiche they knewe not before, and that they were counterfaites, and emptie of true fayeth, ought to be agaſt, and to quake at this their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ngodlines, and to be moued wyth earneſte repentaunce, and to flee wyth all their herte vnto Chriſte whiche maye deliuer them of thys infidelitie, &amp; gyue them ſtronge fayth, etc. For God ſendeth ſuch miſeries, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations for thys purpoſe, that in them me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4169:104"/> myghte beholde, trie, and acknowledge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues in a glaſſe. For whyle they be in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, they lyue careleſly, they runne not to God, they neglecte to heare his worde, they call not vpon God, they thynke that they knowe him, and haue all thynges that they neede.</p>
               <p>Some vndre the croſſe call their ſynnes paſſed, to remembraunce, and weygh them worthely at length, and lamente them, and truly repent of them. For whyle they haue all thynges at pleaſure, for the moſte parte, they neglecte their ſinnes, they deſpice the wrath of God, and thynke it not to be ſo muche as, they heare it to be preached. But when the croſſe, and afliction cometh vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their mynde is aflight, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidereth not that the thynges, whiche it ſuffereth, be the ſcourges of Goddes wrath, it feareth leſte God wyll ſhewe him ſelfe hereafter a rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous iudge, and reuenger of wicked actes, and not a gentle father. The man conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in thys chaſtiſing of God al his ſinnes whereby he deſirued the puniſhmentes a greate whyle before, whiche he nowe ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, he weigheth them worthely at the laſt, and condemneth him ſelfe, and ſayeth wyth him ſelfe in thys, and that ſynne, I well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued thys correction of God.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4169:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p> If then true repentaunce come into his mynde, and if he flee to the mercie of God in Chriſt, he is healped alſo with grace. For God therfore ſendeth vs aflictions that we ſhoulde acknowledge oure ſinnes, that we ſhoulde condemne our ſelues, and turne to the Lorde, as Paul moniſheth. i. Cor. xi. ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, for this cauſe, that is to ſaye, bicauſe ye celebrate the ſupper of the Lorde vnworthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not religiouſly, there be many weake and feeble amonge you, and manie ſleepe, and he addeth, if we had iudged our ſelues, that is to ſay, if we had repented our ſinnes and amended our life, we ſhould not be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that is, we ſhould not be ſubiected to ſo manie euyls. But when we iudge not oure ſelues, God iudgeth and chaſtiſeth vs, not wyth an enemous, but wyth a beniuolent, and fatherlie mynde, that he maye putte vs in remembraunce of our ſynnes, and call vs againe to repentaunce, and this it is, that he ſayeth afterwarde. But when we be iudged of God, we be corrected, that we be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned wyth the worlde. Such then learne in the croſſe the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tuous, and fatherly will of God in that, that they knowe that God wyll not the death of a ſynner, but rather that he be conuerted, and lyue, as Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiell teſtifieth. xviij. Whereunto he dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb facs="tcp:4169:105"/> euen wyth his ſcourges.</p>
               <p>Other in the croſſe acknowledge not their ſynnes onely, or not chiefely, as men hauing obteyned remiſſion therof, and which ſinnes be couered by the mercie of God, but they gette muche more knowledge, of the mercie and excedynge goodnes of God, as he that was borne blyude, Iohn. ix. Of whom whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the diſciples had moued a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether he or his Parentes had ſynned, that he ſhoulde be borne blynde. Ieſus anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, neither hath thys man ſynned nor his Parentes, but that the workes of God maye be made manifeſt in him. etc. Of thys ſorte be the aflictions of them, whiche haue ſomwhat profited in chriſtian religion. For God is muche redier to giue, and to healpe, then we be to aſke it, whiche thynge appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth euidently by thys, that he ſteareth vs vp wyth ſo manie his preceptes, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to pray to him ſelfe, promiſing alſo that he wyl gyue vs, what ſo euer we aſke in the name of Chriſte his ſonne. Therefore that we maye acknowledge this his ſo bountu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and verie fatherly loue towardes vs, he layeth a croſſe vpon vs, wherein he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayneth vs to call vpon hym, that hearing vs, and deliuering from euyls, and heaping benifittes vpon vs, he may declare his good
<pb facs="tcp:4169:105" rendition="simple:additions"/> wyll towarde vs, and moue vs to loue hym agayne, and to magnifie hym, accordyng to the ſentence of the Pſal. Call vpon me in the daye of trouble, and I wyll deliuer the, and thou ſhalte glorifie me. This way the croſſe is eaſely ſuffered, and becometh pleaſaunt. For who woulde not be blynde for a whyle if he knewe that his ſyght ſhoulde be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him ſone after by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of Chriſt hym ſelfe, and alſo inwarde ſyght wyth the outwarde. Who woulde not wiſhe exie, and perſecution with Dauid, if he knewe that he ſhoulde be merueylouſly deliuered of God, and that he ſhoulde be extolled to ſanctifie his name, and dilate his knyngdome. Who woulde not choſe to be troubled, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced wyth Iob, if he knewe that at length, he ſhoulde be pronounced ryghtuous by the iudgement of the diuine maieſtie it ſelfe, and that he ſhoulde recouer his former dignitie, yea and more to both in temporal, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting goodes. But we muſt be as certaine of the healpe of God, and deliueraunce, as Dauid, Iob and other were, whoſe exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the ſcripture ſetteth before vs, ſo that we call vpon God wyth true fayth. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people muſte be often warned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of bi the miniſters, that by this meane, faith and the inuocation of God, beinge nowe
<pb facs="tcp:4169:106"/> welnigh quenched, may be raiſed vp againe and floriſhe.</p>
               <p>There be ſome alſo whiche whyle they are aflicted, learne the peculiar loue of god towardes them, and gette glorie euen in the croſſe, as the Apoſtles. Act. v. When they were beaten wyth roddes for the name of Chriſte, and confeſſion of the Goſpel, went from the councell reioyſinge that they were compted worthie to be ſpitefully handled for his names ſake. Therefore it muſte be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the peculiar goodnes of god, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he iudgeth vs worthy to be troubled for his names ſake, for if we ſuffre wyth hym, we ſhall alſo be glorified wyth him, as Paule witneſſeth. Ro. viij. Surely it was a greate benifitte, and greate glorie to the Apoſtles that they had ſo great fayth, and loue to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mote the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, that they thought they oughte to reioyſe, and to glorie in the trouble and deſpite whiche they ſuffered for the name of Chriſte, whereof vndoubtedly they toke great conſolation. Therefore chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men muſte euer labour to gette ſuche perfection, whiche reade that manie Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres ſhewed, men, women, chyldren, yonge, and olde, learned, and vnlearned, ſo that we maye once ſaye wyth Paule. Be it farre from me that I glorie, ſauynge in the croſſe
<pb facs="tcp:4169:106" rendition="simple:additions"/> of oure Lorde Ieſu Chriſte. etc.</p>
               <p>In this place it ſhal pertayne to the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to arme the people agaynſte the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Anabaptiſtes, whiche contende that no croſſe auayleth to health, ſauynge that, that is layed vpon vs for faythes ſake, and for the confeſſion of Chriſte, neither wil they acknowledge anie to be a chriſtian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which hath not this croſſe that he ſuffre per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of Chriſte. Whoſe errour is lyke the erroure of the donatiſtes, whiche as S. Auguſtine witneſſeth, draue men euen agaynſte theyr wylles to kylle them ſelues.</p>
               <p>Therfore the preachers muſte teache the people three kyndes of aflictions, and of the croſſe. Firſt, when we ſuffre perſecution for the confeſſion of Chriſte, and for rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whiche afliction, &amp; croſſe is moſte hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and moſt to be wiſhed for accordynge to the ſaying of Chriſte Math. v. Bleſſed be they that ſuffre perſecutions for ryghtuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſake. etc.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde kinde of tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God correcteth vs for ſynne, and calleth vs agayne vnto repentaunce, as be diſeaſes, pouertie, hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gre, peſtilence. etc. In theſe if we ſhewe patience to God, and obey his wyll, and ſeeke his grace in Chriſte, being ſo pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb facs="tcp:4169:107"/> wyth true repentaunce of ſynnes, and earneſt fayth, thys ſhalbe a pleaſaunt ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto God, whiche thynge is toutched in the parable Luke. xiij. Of the great bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kette, to whiche the bidden geſtes refuſed to come, and the pore, lame blynde. etc. were brought, and compelled to come.</p>
               <p>The thirde kynde of the croſſe is, when malefactours are puniſhed for their wicked actes, as he murtherers, adulterers, theues, robbers. Thys kynde of tribulation beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not chriſtian men. Wherfore we muſt take diligent hede, that we be not troubled thys waye, as wicked, and euylles doers. i. Petri. iiij. Lette none of you be aflicted as a murtherer, as theſe. etc. But if anie man be troubled as a chriſtian, let hym not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but glorifie God in thys behalfe. But if anie ſuche thing chaunce, and if ſome hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous act be committed, the perſon muſt not deſpeare therfore, but he muſt acknowledge that he is puniſhed for his deſeruing. Wher fore he muſte haue patience, and praye for forgyuenes, and ſo thys croſſe though it be brought vpon vs thorowe our wicked actes becometh holie, &amp; acceptable to God, as we may ſe in the thiefe, whiche on the croſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and called vpon Chriſte.</p>
               <p>Here the preachers ſhall alſo warne dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:107" rendition="simple:additions"/> that it is not in our choyſe to lay the croſſe vpon vs, as we liſte, but that euerie man muſte beare that croſſe, whiche God layeth vpon hym, accordynge to the ſayinge of Chriſt, he that wyl be my diſciple let him take vp his owne croſſe, not Chriſtes croſſe, or Petres, or Paules, but his owne.

The onely exemple of Iohn the Euangeliſte proueth ſufficiently that it is not neceſſarie that euerie man be exerciſed wyth the croſſe, for the confeſſion of fayth. For thys ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hough he were right deare vnto Chriſte, yet he dyed a naturall death and in extreme age, and was not put to death for the confeſſion of fayeth, as the moſte parte of the other Apoſtles were.</p>
               <p>Furthermore thys thynge alſo muſt be taught about thys place, that it is not onely profitable, but alſo neceſſarie that we be troubled in thys lyfe, and exerciſed with ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie aduerſities, by reaſon of our naughtie fleſhe, and olde Adam, to whiche it is neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to be repreſſed, &amp; tamed wyth the croſſe, as meate and drynke be needeful for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. For oure olde man in proſperitie for the moſte parte wareth riotous, and inſolent,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:108"/> forgetteth God, and looſeth the brydle to al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>luſtes, and miſchiues, as Moyſes teſtifieth, Deut. xxxij. The beloued was batted, and kycked, he was batted, and made fatte, and lefte God his maker, and departed from God his health. Wherfore Solomon pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Pro. xxx. Neither pouertie, nor rytches gyue me, leſte I beinge fylled denie the, and ſaye who is the Lorde. etc. To auoyed theſe ſo great euyls, the croſſe is ſurely neceſſarie, ſo that if God lay vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs no peculiar croſſe we muſt humble, and chaſtiſe our fleſhe our ſelues, as Paule wrate of hym ſelfe. i. Cor. ix. I chaſtiſe my bodie, and brynge it into bondage. etc. For the olde man muſt needes be mortified and periſhe, if the newe ſhalbe renued. And thys the holie goſte worketh in vs, chiefely by the law and aflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are moued, and nurtured to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande the lawe. Wherefore in baptiſme we ſubmitte oure ſelues, to the croſſe, and to death, accordynge to the ſayinge of Paule, Ro. vi. As manie of vs as be baptiſed into Chriſte, are baptiſed into his death. etc. And a litle after, we knowe that our olde man is crucified wyth hym, that the bodie of ſynne myght be aboliſhed, that hereafter we ſerue not ſynne, that is to ſaye, that God hath ſet vs forth an exemple in Chriſte, in whom we
<pb facs="tcp:4169:108" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhoulde learne that our olde man muſt dye, and that therefore he is euer ſubiecte to the croſſe. For he that is dead, ſayeth Paule, is iuſtified from ſynne. Therfore as neceſſarie as it is that oure olde man dye, and ceaſe from ſynnes, ſo neceſſarie is the croſſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whiche the olde man can neither be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med nor mortified.</p>
               <p>Beſyde thys profitte and neceſſitie of the croſſe, the dignitie alſo, and glorie of the ſame muſte be diligently commended to the people. For God woulde haue his owne ſonne, in whom he had delite, as he teſtified wyth a voice from heauen, to be exalted by the croſſe, and death, and to be crouned with glorie, and honour. Hebr. ij.

Wherefore thoughe there were none other profitte in the croſſe, yet for thys cauſe onely we oughte to ſuffre it, patiently and gladly, that we maye be made lyke vnto Chriſte. For ſeinge that Chriſt was ryght deare, and acceptable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God thorowe obedience of the croſſe, the fathers wyll was, that al whiche ſhoulde be glorified wyth him, ſhould ſuffre with him, as Paule fayeth, Ro. viij.

And if we be chyldren, then be we heyres, heyres I ſaye of God, and coheyres wyth Chriſte, if we ſuffre wyth him, that we may be glorified wyth hym. Our afliction alſo is planted in the paſſion of Chriſte, for tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row baptiſme we are grafted into his death Ro. vi.

               <p>The croſſe then is an entraunce to glory, and lyfe, as Paule ſaye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Seinge then that euerie croſſe is from

               <p>If theſe thynges ſhalbe prynted in men diligently, and commended vnto them, they ſhalbe eaſely retayned, that they be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in aduerſities, that ſome fall not into impatiencie, ſome ſlee to vngodlie aides agaynſt affictions, but hauing their mindes ſtabliſhed wyth the truſt of Goddes good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, they ſhall gladly ſubmitte them ſeues

               <head>¶ Of the churche of God.</head>
               <p>THe viſible churche of God in this life, is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of perſonnes truly beleuyng the worde of God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto vs by Chriſte, and the Apoſtles, &amp; of perſonnes borne agayne tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the holy goſte. In whiche compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie manie abyde in thys lyfe not borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, hauyng ſinnes agaynſt theyr conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſentyng in doctrine, and true vſe of the ſacramentes. As in Paules tyme there were at Corinthe, and in other places amonge chriſtians, both godlie men hauing the holie goſte, and alſo ſome that ſynned agaynſte theyr conſcience, whiche neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſpake not agaynſt the true doctrine, and ryght vſe of the ſacramentes, but toke them wyth other in the congregation. And it is receyued by cuſtome, that the godlie be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the quicke me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres of the churche. Theſe men whyle they be not excommunicated, may execute eccleſiaſtical offices in teaching
<pb facs="tcp:4169:111"/> and miniſtringe the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, neither ſhal theyr vngodlines hurt the godlines of them whiche vſe theyr miniſterie wythout allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng of their vngodlines.</p>
               <p>Al be it then that the congregations, and miniſters of the ſame ought to take diligent hede, that vnworthy men be not receyued to the holie miniſterie, and if they be receyued that as ſone as theyr vngodlines is ſpied, they be remoued from the ſame agayne, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles of what meane ſorte ſo euer they be that miniſtre in holie thynges, whyle the congregation ſuffereth them, they to whom they miniſtre the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of Chriſt muſt neuer regarde the perſon, or worthines of the miniſters, but the commaundement, and promiſe of Chriſte in the holie miniſterie.</p>
               <p>For the Lorde maketh thoſe thynges which he hym ſelfe hath ordeined in his churche, to be effectuous vnto the health of his, though the miniſters be neuer ſo vnworthy, and he requireth that the fayeth of his people be grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon his worde, and not vpon the worthineſſe of the miniſters. Therefore Chriſte ſayeth he that heareth you, heareth me, that is to ſay, it is my worde, and it wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth thorowe me, the fayeth of myne muſte leane hereupon, and not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vertue, and worthines of the miniſters. For thys cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:4169:111" rendition="simple:additions"/> he compareth the churche to a fiſhers nette wherewith good, and euyl fiſhes are taken. And math. xiij. He teſtifieth that the euyll muſte not be ſeuered from the good before the later daye. The churche muſte be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed here, and warre vndre the croſſe, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt fleſhe, and bloud, but alſo againſt the deuyll hym ſelfe, ſome of the membres thereof as it were ſtonpynge and gyuynge place, ſome beinge quite ouerthrowen, and ſome recoueryng them ſelues agayne, and renuinge the fyghte. And though manie in the churche ſhall gyue place to Satan, and to the fleſhe, and ſhall be oppreſſed of theſe enemies, yet euer ſome membres of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation muſt ſtande, and ouercome, ſome tyme more, and ſometyme fewer.</p>
               <p>Wherfore there ſhal euer be ſome viſible congregation on the earth, as Chriſte hym ſelfe promiſeth Mathewe the laſte. Lo I am wyth you vnto the ende of the worlde. And Eſaie. xlix. The Lorde ſayeth. And I haue made thys couenaunt wyth them, ſayth the Lorde, my ſpirite which is vpon the, and the workes, whiche I haue putte in thy mouth ſhall not departe from thy mouth, nor from the mouth of thy ſede, ſayth the Lorde, from thys tyme vnto euerlaſtyng.</p>
               <p>Thys ſentence teacheth what the church
<pb facs="tcp:4169:112"/> is, and that it ſhall endure euer. And it is a great conſolation to holde both partes, that we maye be ſure, that God hath not caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye whole mankynde, but that he wyll euer heare, and ſaue vs. But where wyll he do thys thynge? Anſwer. Not amonge the heathen, or deſperate Iewes, or Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes, or obſtinate aduerſaries of Chriſte, but amonge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely whiche heare, retayne and beleue the worde, whiche the heauenlie father hath putte in the mouthe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, and of his ſonne, and call vpon hym accordynge to his moſte ample promiſes.</p>
               <p>Thys conſolation taken out of the doctrine concernynge the congregation is diligently to be conſidered, and printed deeply into our myndes, and therefore the preachers muſte often rehearſe theſe thynges to the people.</p>
               <p>Furthermore that groſſe, and pernitious errour of the Donatiſtes, and Anabaptiſtes muſte be reproued, whiche called the people from the worde of God, and the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes to the perſon of the miniſters deniyng there miniſtery to be effectuous, which had ſinnes agaynſt conſcience. How be it this is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God, in the callynge of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes, and miniſters, that ſuche miniſters be choſen for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations, as be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueable. And if while they be in theyr mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie
<pb facs="tcp:4169:112" rendition="simple:additions"/> they fal into wycked actes, that they be remoued from the ſame agayne, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the ordre, whiche the Lorde hath ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poynted, wherof we wyll ſpeake hereafter. In the meane whyle, as I ſayed, we muſte euer haue regarde to the commaundement of God in the worde, and the ſacramentes, and not to the perſon of the miniſters. For we ſpeake here of the viſible churche, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in good, and badde be mengled togyther in thys lyfe. And god made mankinde for this purpoſe, that there myght be ſome amonge whom he myght be knowen, whiche ſhould call vpon him, and magnifie hym. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo he ſent his ſonne oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and in hym he hath opened the exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rytches of his grace towardes vs, that they mygh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e be vnfolded and diſtributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge vs, wherby many myght be ſaued. And bicauſe that theſe workes of Goddes goodnes muſte be manifeſte in the worlde, there muſte needes be a viſible churche, that is to ſaye, ſuche a companie, in whiche thys wyl of God towardes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is preached, and celebrated. Therefore the Pſalme ſayeth of ſuche a viſible churche. Their ſounde went into all the worlde.</p>
               <p>But that the churche maye be knowen, and diſcerned from other polities, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:113"/> it hath certayne propre ſignes, namely theſe that folowe. The firſt ſigne is true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine deliuered to the church in the Goſpel, by Chriſte, and the Apoſtles after a true vnderſtanding. The ſeconde is the true and lawfull vſe of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, which Chriſt ordeined. The thirde ſigne is confeſſion of godlie doctrine, whiche is made both in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng vpon God, and reteynynge the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and diſcipline of Chriſte wyth the ſayntes, and alſo in profeſſynge and mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinyng the Goſpel when neede is amonge them, whiche be wythout the churche.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>¶ Of the vnitie or concorde of the churche.</head>
               <p>AL be it that the churche in manie thynges be vnlyke the politike or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the worlde, (for it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte vnto the croſſe) yet it is like in that poynt, that is principall, and beſt in all comon weales, that is to ſaye, in greate vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and coniunction of the membres amonge them ſelues. And the coniunction, and vnitie of the churche conſiſteth in three poyntes chiefely. The firſt is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent in the doctrine of the Goſpell, and true vnderſtandynge of the ſame, which ſeinge that the Iewes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometiſtes, heretikes, and aduerſaries of
<pb facs="tcp:4169:113" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Goſpell haue not, they be not the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of the churche, though the Iewes, and Mahometiſtes glorie much, that they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyppe the true God, and manie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyue well, and honeſtly. For it is certayne that they are not of the people of God, and ther fore that they be caſt away from God, and damned for euer, as many as blaſpheme the ſonne of God our ſauiour, and profeſſe ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they acknowledge hym not, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue his doctrine deliuered to the churche by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles. Therfore they be the enemies of god, and ſubiected to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation.</p>
               <p>In lyke maner though heretikes, and per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecutours of the Goſpell, reteyne ſome arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the euangelicall doctrine, and boſte them ſelues to be chriſtians, and manie of them lyue honeſtly, and excell in vertues of the outwarde lyfe, yet they be not membres of the churche. For the ſentence Math. xij. is ſure and certayne, he that blaſphemeth the holie goſte, it ſhall not be forgyuen hym in thys worlde, nor in the worlde to come. For to blaſpheme the holie goſt, is to ſpeake euil of the allowed truth, whiche was reueyled by the holie goſte, and the miniſterie of the Apoſtles. Item. ij. Iohn. i. Euerie one that tranſgreſſeth, and tarieth not in the doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:4169:114"/> of Chriſte, hath not God. So Gala. i. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie man preache a Goſpell to you beſyde that, that ye haue receyued, be he accurſed. Hereof it maye be knowen alſo, that they be none of the churche of Chriſt, whiche folow ſtraunge doctrine, bicauſe that ſuche haue partly heathniſhe opinions of the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as Manicheus, whiche fayned that there were two Goddes, one good, an other euyll, both eternall, and partly they haue Iewiſhe errours of the ſonne of God, and the holie Goſte, as Samoſatenus and ſuche lyke. Neither is it obſcure that they perteine not to the churche of Chriſte, whiche wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe from Chriſte the Lorde, the glorie of a Mediatoure, aſſignynge the remiſſion of ſynnes to the deſeruynges of workes, and deuiſing peculiar workes or worſhippinges of God. The ſame thynge do they, whiche denie originall ſynne, and ſeeke iuſtice tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe theyr owne worthines, whiche take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye proprietie of goodes, whiche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne officers, and iudgementes ordeined by the commaundement of God, as the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes do, theſe felowes pinche from Chriſt, and from the holiegoſte, whiche holy goſte rebuketh original ſynne, and ordeyneth, and defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth politike ordres. Wherof it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that ſuche be not the true membres of
<pb facs="tcp:4169:114" rendition="simple:additions"/> the churche, bycauſe that either they refuſe all togyther the doctrine of the Apoſtles, or mangle ſome article of the the ſame inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretyng them agaynſt the vniuerſal conſent of the true churche.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde thynge required to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the churche, is concorde concernyng the ryght vſe of thoſe ſacramentes, whiche Chriſte inſtituted.</p>
               <p>The third is obedience towardes the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of the Goſpell in all thoſe thynges for whiche we haue the commaundementes of God, I meane that the people heare the worde of God of the miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, whiche be lawfully called, and teache ſincerely. Item that they receyue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes of them, and obey them, if tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the authoritie, and iuriſdiction of the churche ordeyned of Chriſte, they be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, rebuked, and puniſhed for their ſynnes, or excommunicated. For the miniſters muſt be neceſſarely obeied in thoſe thinges, which are commaunded in the Goſpell Luke. x. He that heareth you, heareth me. etc. Hebr. xiij. Obey the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be your gouerners, for they watche for your ſoules, as men that ſhall gyue accompte of their office. etc. But the faythfull miniſters ſuffre perſecution of the open aduerſaries of the Goſpel, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
<pb facs="tcp:4169:115"/> by it ſelfe, is full of great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, cares, and miſeries. Wherfore it is a great croſſe, if there be added vnto it arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant behauiour, and contempt of theyr hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. So contrarie wyſe it is a great conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and diſburthenyng of theyr labours, and paynes, when their hearers obey them in the Lorde, and declare a thankfull mynde for their labours, and cares. Whiche thinge maketh alſo for thys purpoſe, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of the whole church be maynteyned, that the doctrine of Chriſte be ſette forth more, and more. Finally that the offices of loue be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely excerciſed, and that the inſtauration of the whole churche go wel forwarde. As co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie wyſe where there is contempte, and ſtubburnes of the ſubiectes, the holie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cord of the people of God is drawen a ſundre, the doctrine of the Goſpell is obſcured, and corrupted, mutuall offices of edification are hindred, and manie other offences ſprynge vp, and the wylde behauiour of manie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth. Therefore that the churche of the Lorde may be maynteyned, and grow forth he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him ſelfe, that neceſſarie obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſhould be ſhewed to the miniſters of congregations, in thoſe thynges whiche be committed vnto them in the Goſpell. For they muſte exerciſe the authoritie of Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:115" rendition="simple:additions"/> &amp; not of their owne. Wherefore of them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues they haue no ryght to commaunde anie thing to the people of Chriſt, neither ought the people to obey them, if they do ſo. For chriſtian men can obey no man in thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whiche be agaynſte God, as all thoſe thynges be, whiche are ordeyned, and enac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted concernyng religion not of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of Chriſte. But whyle the paſtours require, &amp; enioyne thoſe thynges, for which they haue the commaundement of Chriſte, they that in thys caſe refuſe to obey, caſte of the yoke of Chriſte. Paule wyth a great ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite exhorteth to thys concorde of the church and agreinge togyther of the membres of Chriſte amonge them ſelues, both in other places, and alſo in the epiſtle to the Eph. iiij Therefore, I whiche am a priſoner of the Lorde, exhorte you, that you ſo walke, as it becometh the vocation, wherwith ye are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, with all ſubmiſſion, and meakenes, with ſoftnes of mynde, ſufferynge one an other thorowe loue, labourynge to keepe the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſpirite by the bonde of peace. One bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and ſpirite. etc.</p>
               <p>But it is manifeſt that Paul calleth that the vnitie of the ſpirite in thys place, that is in the true doctrine of Chriſte, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the commaundementes of God.
<pb facs="tcp:4169:116"/> For the holie goſte worketh thys vnitie in them whiche beleue, and thys vnitie of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite bryngeth, and preſerueth the true peace, and edification of the churche.</p>
               <p>And the maner and ordre of choſynge or callynge the miniſters of the congregation, which the holie goſte hath appoynted in the ſcriptures, maketh for the preſeruation of thys vnitie. For as S. Paule ſayeth, Ephe. iiij. Chriſte aſcending vp on high ledde cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie captyue, and gaue gyftes vnto men, prophetes, apoſtles, feeders and teachers. And though Chriſte hym ſelfe, as the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle wytneſſeth, doth choſe and appoynt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to his churche, yet he doth the ſame for the moſte parte by the worke, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of his churche. To whiche churche he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to bringe vp, and to teache perpetuallye ſome vnto thys miniſterye, whiche beinge furniſhed for the ſame mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, muſt be called, and appointed by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full choſynge, and triall. Wherefore there hath remayned euer in the churche a maner to bryng vp, and frame ſome to the holie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the church, and alſo to receyue them whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be brought vp, and furniſhed, and to ordeyne them, when they be fitte for that purpoſe.

               <head>¶ Of chriſtian prayer.</head>
               <p>TRue Chriſten praier healpeth alſo verie muche to the conſeruation, maynteynyng, and encreaſyng of godlines as we warned before.</p>
               <p>For thorowe it we muſte aſke, and receyue what ſo euer we loke for of God by fayth. But thys exerciſe alſo of religion is waxen ſo colde, yea is ſo quenched almoſte, that ſcarcely any know howe to praye truly, and chriſtianly. In the begynnyng of the church the ſtudie of praying ſo floriſhed that not a fewe miracles were done by prayer, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue manie exemples. Neither ſhould the ſtrength of prayer be any thynge leſſe nowe, if we dyd applie it, ſtudiouſly, and wyth true fayth. Therfore that the diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of prayer maye be reſtored againe, it ſhal
<pb facs="tcp:4169:117"/> be the miniſters dutie, to exhorte the people vnto it dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, and to enſtruct them of the ſame after thys ſorte.</p>
               <p>Fyrſte foraſmuche as it can not be, that anie man ſhall praye truely, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepte ſome daunger, or neceſſitie of lyfe driue hym thereto, the preacher ſhall labour diligently to ſet before the peoples eyes the neceſſitie of prayinge by reaſon of the euyls and daungers whiche hange ouer all men, &amp; ought to driue euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pray earneſtly.</p>
               <p>Two kyndes of euylles, and daungers moue vs to praye. The one kynde is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, the other is ſecrete. To the firſte, as all men knowe, diſeaſes pertaine, and pouertie, perſecution, infamie, hatred, warre, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, death, hereſies. etc. What ſo euer be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly hurtfull, whether they be corporall, or ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>And though all men do feele, and take greuouſly theſe euylles, yet there be fewe, whiche ſo take them, and be ſo greued for them, as they ſhoulde, and as the religion of Chriſt requireth, that is to ſay, as the ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of God, &amp; puniſhmentes of their ſinnes whiche they ſhoulde labour to auoyed with true repentaunce and fayth. Therefore the preachers muſte teache and warne the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diligently, that all theſe euylles happen
<pb facs="tcp:4169:117" rendition="simple:additions"/> thorowe the wrath of God agaynſt ſynnes, that in the ſame, they maye learne to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre not onely theyr daunger, and griefe, but muche more the angre of God. And further what damages, what deſtruction of bodie, and ſoule, and of al honeſtie ryſeth vpon the ſame, that ſo the people maye be ſteared vp to religious, and feruent prayer.</p>
               <p>The ſecrete daungers to whiche we be ſubiecte, are the ſnares that Satan layeth for vs by all occaſions, ſeekyng the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bodie, ſoule, goodes, &amp; name. Which ſnares we coulde neuer ſcape, excepte God of his vnmeaſurable mercie, and loue dyd defende vs by his angelles. Otherwyſe he woulde eaſely take away our lyfe wyth his venemous breath, in ſome places he woulde ſteare vp robberies, and murthers in other tempeſtes, in other warres: he woulde take from ſome men theyr mynde wyth horrible viſions, he woulde leade ſome out of theyr waye into vnknowen places, he woulde throwe ſome from theyr horſes, ſome from ſteares, ſome into waters. Some ſhoulde be killed with the fal of an houſe, ſome ſhoulde be torne of wylde beaſtes. Some ſhoulde be infected, or leeſe theyr lyfe wyth venemous beaſtes. In ſome places he would ſette hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on fyre, in ſome he woulde droune all, he
<pb facs="tcp:4169:118"/> woulde cauſe ſome to kyll them ſelues, he woulde dryue ſome out of theyr wyttes, he woulde furniſhe ſome wyth euyl craftes to hurte other mennes lyfe, and goodes, as we ſe done wyth ſundrie enchauntmentes. In other places he woulde ouerthrowe diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and honeſtie wyth all kyndes of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheues. In ſome places he woulde fyll ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried folkes, and houſeholders wyth hatred, brawlynges, venimmes, and murthers. In ſome places he would trouble como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weales wyth greate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motions, and ſeditions. He woulde gyue ſome men witte and minde to depraue the ſcriptures, and to corrupt ciuile lawes. He woulde tangle ſome wyth plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and deſtroye the ſame in bodie, and ſoule. He woulde ſo opreſſe ſome wyth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, that he woulde drawe them from godlines to a careles, impenitent, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureous lyfe. He woulde dryue ſome hauing committed greuous offences vnto deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some tyme he woulde trouble the churche wyth ſore ſclaunders, and ſomtyme (counterfaiting an angel of lyght) he would brynge in falſe doctrine and noyſome exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of lyfe. Some tymes he woulde ſteare vp hereſies, and Idolatries. Briefely there ſhoulde be nothynge in all the worlde, ſafe from his malice, &amp; violence, which he would
<pb facs="tcp:4169:118" rendition="simple:additions"/> not depraue, corrupt, and deſtroy, he would fyll all the worlde wyth calamities, ſynnes, death, and all miſchiefe, excepte that God dyd breake, and lette his tirannie. For he is the prince of the worlde, merueylous mygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whiche beareth rule in the ayre. Ephe. ij. And he worketh in the vnfaythfull, ſo that it is not harde for hym to ſowe ſuch errours and offences, wherewyth euen the choſen myghte be brought to deſtruction if it were poſſible. As we maye well ſe in Iob, neither want we lyke exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples in theſe dayes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyth God admoniſheth vs both of the dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger, whiche hangeth ouer vs thorowe the malice of Satan, and alſo of his protection whereby he diſapoynteth Satans purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that we ſhoulde euer praye for thys his defence, and acknowledge it wyth thankes gyuyng. Wherefore the preachers ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare theſe daungers diligently, that they maye learne how manie, and neceſſarie cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes there be, that oughte euer to ſteare and dryue vs to prayer, and to learne of that our carnall careleſnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly the preachers ſhal note the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſes of God, whiche are ſette forth euerie where in the ſcripture, wherein God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that he wyll turne awaye ſuche perils, and deliuer vs, when we be fallen in them.
<pb facs="tcp:4169:119"/> And they ſhall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende the ſame to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diligently, when occaſion ſhal ſerue, that they maye learne to loke vpon them religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in theyr prayers, and to rayſe vp their myndes therewyth vnto a ſure truſte to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Goddes healpe. For that prayer may be harde, it muſte needes be done in fayeth, and in the name of Chriſte, as Chriſte hym<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe warneth, what ſo euer ye aſke in my name beleuynge, ye ſhall receyue it. Math. xxi. Item, what ſo euer ye ſhall aſke the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my name, he ſhal giue it you. Io. xvi.</p>
               <p>Therfore that we maye beleue that oure praier is harde, we muſt needes haue Gods worde, and promiſe, whiche we may beleue. For otherwiſe it ſhoulde be a falſe truſt, and vngodlines, if we dyd learne onely vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our owne iudgement, and perſuaſion. A promiſe then out of the worde of God, where vpon our prayer maye leane, is neceſſarie, without the whiche we can in no wyſe praye truely, neither yet be harde. But thys thynge muſt alſo be added, that it be done in the name of Chriſt. And that we do, not onely when we praye wyth theſe wordes, we beſeche the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther almyghtie God thorowe Ieſus Chriſt thy ſonne our Lorde, but alſo when we pray onely for thoſe thinges, whiche Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs to praye for, ſo that after thys
<pb facs="tcp:4169:119" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſorte we maye praye truely, O Lorde God heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father we come not to pray vnto the thorowe our owne luſt, or confidence, but by the inſtitution, and commaundement of thy onely begotten ſonne, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue thys ſentence, and promiſe, that thou wylte heare vs for his ſake. Neither do we praye, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng in our worthines, or in oure merites, for we knowe that we haue deſerued no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge ſauinge wrath, and puniſhment, but in the name of thy ſonne, that is to ſaye, that thou wylt heare vs for his ſake and merite. This is to pray truly in the name of Chriſt neither can it be, but that we ſhall be hearde as often as we praye wyth ſuche a mynde, and ſuche a ſure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence, as Iohn wytneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. i. Epiſt. v. Thys is the truſte that we haue towardes God, that it we ſhal aſke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thynge accordyng to his wyll, he heareth vs. etc. Therefore the preachers ſhal declare to the people diligently, what a great ſynne doubtyng is in prayer. For ſeinge that our prayer hath the promiſe of God laied before it, it foloweth, that he which doubteth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be hearde or no, doubteth alſo whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God be true, whether he perfourm the thynge, that he promiſeth. And there can be no greater ſhame done to God, then if we doubte whether he be true. And therfore the
<pb facs="tcp:4169:120"/> prayer of a man that doubteth can obtayne nothynge, as Iames teacheth. i. Chap. He that doubteth, is lyke the waues of the ſea, whiche is toſſed wyth the wyndes. Let not a doubtynge man thinke, that he ſhal receyue any thynge of the Lorde. A man that wane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in all his dedes can do nothynge wyth a quiet conſcience.</p>
               <p>In the meane whyle the preachers muſte loke hereunto, that they gently handle the weake conſciences of the godlie, which ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the promiſes of God, and that they healpe theyr weakenes wyth ſome good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, teachyng that Chriſte wyll merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully beare their weaknes for a ceaſon, as he beare the weakenes of his diſciples, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen after his reſurrection he vnbrayded vn beliefe wyth muche ſoftnes. But they ſhall exhorte them to praye thus conſtantly wyth the diſciples, Lorde encreaſe our fayth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they ſhal teache the people, that God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded vs, that what ſo euer good thynges we lacke, we ſhoulde aſke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hym, and alſo that he wyll remoue the euyls that oppreſſe vs. Aſke, ſayeth Chriſte, Math. vij. And ye ſhal receyue. Item, Iohn. xvi. Aſke, and ye ſhal receyue, that your ioy maye be ful. Luke. xviij. He teacheth vs with an apte ſimilitude, that we muſte praye euer
<pb facs="tcp:4169:120"/> and wythout ceaſyng. The Lorde requireth the ſame thynge in the beginnyng of the ten commaundementes, when he ſayeth, I am the Lorde thy God, thou ſhalte not haue ſtraunge Goddes before me, ſanctifie my name. For he that acknowledgeth the Lorde his God, that is to ſaye, hym whiche onely giueth all good thynges, and alone putteth awaye all euyll, and he that ſetteth his truſt in no creature beſydes the Lorde, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſireth wyth all his herte, all his ſoule and all his ſtrength to ſanctifie, extoll, and glorifie the name of the Lorde, this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt needes aſke al thynges of God, and require healpe of hym agaynſt al euyls, and prayſe and magnifie hym for the ſame, accordynge to the Pſalme. l. Call vpon me in the day of tribulation, and I wyl deliuer the, and thou ſhalt glorifie me. Wherfore as he ſinneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte the lawe, whiche honoureth not his parentes, whiche committeth thefte, lyeth, and offendeth agaynſte other commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, ſo they ſynne ryghte greuouſly, and agaynſte the principall commaundementes of the lawe, whiche call not vpon God in theyr doinges, neither aſke of hym, what thynge ſo euer they neede, whether it be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, or ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>And that thys ſynne maye be more eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:4169:121"/> auoyded, it is a chriſtian, and godlie ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, that chyldren be diligently inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and accuſtomed to prayer, and that a fourme, maner, and ordre of praying be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted vnto them, when, where, howe ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and what they ought to pray. Not that this thynge be made by a lawe, wherby their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſciences maye be entangled in ſuperſtition, but onely that theyr myndes maye be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and accuſtomed to praye, whom alſo it is conuenient to allure to praye wyth chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhe entiſementes, and gyftes. For what ſo euer is broughte into cuſtome in youth, the ſame cleaueth faſte in al ages, whether it be good, or bad. Agayne thynges not accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med are learned wyth greate difficultie in olde age, though they be ryghte profitable, and good, and though we greatly deſire to haue the vſe of the ſame. But to them that feare God, and ſet much by his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, there is nothynge harde. Lette the miniſters then admoniſhe the parentes, that they alſo healpe them therein, that chyldren may be enſtructed, and accuſtomed to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from their chyldhode, chiefely when they go to bedde, when they ryſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come to the table, and go from the ſame, in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when the tyme requireth not to herken to the readynge of the holie ſcripture, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:121" rendition="simple:additions"/> or when they muſte ſynge wyth the congregation. It ſhal be good alſo for the confirmation of godlines in them, to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome them to praye alwayes, when they be alone, or to call to theyr myndes ſome parte of the holie ſcripture, or ſome workes of God. For it is incredible howe manie and greuous euyls maye be auoyded, if idlenes, and thoſe their wanton, and wanderynge thoughtes, when they are alone, be reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wyth godlie prayers, or holie meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And God commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by Moyſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſuche an inſtitution, and exerciſe of chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſaying. Deut. vi. Theſe wordes, which I commaunde the thys daye, ſhalbe in thine herte, and thou ſhalt declare them, and print them in, and muſe vpon them ſittynge in thyne houſe, and walkynge in thy iourney, goyng to bedde, and ryſynge. And that we myghte haue no cauſe of excuſe, either that we haue no leyſure, by reaſon of oure buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or that we can not learne, howe we ſhoulde praye, Chriſte hym ſelfe hath not onely warned vs that we neede not manie wordes, but he alſo hath ſette before vs a moſte apte, ſhorte, and eaſy fourme of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which we cal the Lordes prayer, wherin he hath briefely comprehended what ſo euer we maye praye for, ſo that we learne truely
<pb facs="tcp:4169:122"/> to vnderſtande, and weigh it. And howe it ought to be vnderſtanded, and pondred the preachers maye teache out of our inſtitution if they haue not a more commodious waye them ſelues.</p>

               <head>¶ A ſhorte expoſition of the Lordes prayer.</head>
               <p>ANd this is a ſumme of thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that ought to be conſidered in thys fourme of praying. Firſt we muſte marke the fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie prayer, whiche is the truſte of fatherlie beniuolence, whereof the Lorde warned vs in thys, that he commaunded to call God father, though we be miſerable ſynners. Thys truſte before al thinges muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed thorowe fayeth in oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, that we maye determine, that God is a father to vs alſo, and that he wyll denie no fatherlie thynge to vs beinge nowe his chyldren, for Chriſtes ſake his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſonne, amonge manie brethern, in whom he hath receyued vs into fauour beinge diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited, and caſte awaye for ſynne, and hath begotten vs agayne, and adopted vs into his ſonnes, and made vs partakers, &amp; heyres of eternall lyfe. Wherfore accordyng to his fatherlie loue towardes vs, he wyll ſuffre hym ſelfe to be entreated, if we ſhall pray in
<pb facs="tcp:4169:122" rendition="simple:additions"/> the name of his ſonne, as he hymſelfe hathe commaunded vs. He made mencion of the heauens, that we ſhould remember, that for aſmuch as we are now lifted vp into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly thynges in Chriſt, we ought to aſke hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly thinges, &amp; to thynke vpon the ſame. Wherfore, in thinges that wepraye for, or woulde haue taken awaye of God, he hath preſcribed this order, that our wiſhes for ſpiritual thinges ſhould go before our wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes for bodely thynges. For firſte, he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs to pray, that the name of god be ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctified, that is to ſay: that the name of God the eternal power of God, wyſedome and goodnes, diuine maieſtie, God hymſelfe in Chriſt the Lord may be preached, glorified, acknoledged, called vpon, and magnified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our ſelues, and in all the world tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe manifeſt, ſincere, and conſtant confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion, and preachyng of the Goſpel openly, and priuately, with al mennes wordes and dedes.

We are commaunded to aſke theſe neceſſaries of lyfe dayly, that we maye conſidre, that they be not layed vp in oure ſtorehouſes, but in the prouidence of God, and that they be euer miniſtred vnto vs of the free beniuolence of God, and not gotten by our induſtrie, or ſtrength, howe be it euerie man oughte to applie his indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, and labour to thys bountuouſnes of God, accordynge to the worde of God. He addeth our, and dayly bread, epiouſion, that is to ſaye, that, whiche the inſtant, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vſe of lyfe requireth, that he maye teach vs, that in theſe bodilie thynges we oughte to aſke nor gette no more, then the neede of our lyfe requireth, to prouide the kyngdome of Chriſte in our neighbours, and moreouer that we ſhoulde acknowledge that meaſure of thys oure neede, that the heauenlie father hath limited, and not that oure vnmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſire appointeth, to whom it perteineth alone to meate out to vs his chyldren oure meaſure, that we maye thinke that to be our

               <p>In theſe partes then of thys fourme of prayinge, the Lorde hath taughte vs, what good thinges we muſte pray for of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie father both ſpirituall, and corporall. Afterwarde he teacheth to praye for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing of euyls, namely our miſdedes and ſynnes, whiche we euer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhmentes that we owe to Goddes iuſtice for the ſame. Wherefore he taughte vs to praye. Forgyue vs oure dettes. For we do neuer our duetie ſo religiouſlie in thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges whiche God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, but that yet we owe a great deale more vnto the full obedience of Gods lawe. Nowe we do not onely runne into thoſe dettes of the law not fulfilled, and heape daylie more and more, but alſo we committe manie thinges playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie againſt the lawe, for which we are endet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God of greuous puniſhmentes. And we can paye neither of theſe two kyndes of dettes. For we do not only neuer ſatiſfie the lawe, whereby we runne in newe dettes of the lawe not fulfilled, but alſo oftentymes we committe manie thynges agaynſte the lawe of God, whereby we runne into infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb facs="tcp:4169:124" rendition="simple:additions"/> dettes of puniſhmentes. Wherefore the Lorde taught vs to fleee onely to the mercie of the heauenlie father thorowe hym ſelfe (for we muſte praye for all theſe thynges in his name) and to deſire forgyuenes of oure dettes, and he addeth no condition of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiyng. For the Lorde alone hath ſatiſfied for our ſynnes, and he gyueth vs that ſatiſfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when we committe our ſelues vnto him. But he woulde haue vs to profeſſe, that we wyll forgyue all the dettes that oure neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours maye owe vnto vs, either bicauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt humanitie they haue done vs wrong or bicauſe they haue not done theyr duetie towardes vs, and he wyl that this thinge be ſurely perfourmed.</p>
               <p>For ſeinge that God in al his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, preſcribeth onely thoſe thynges vnto vs, whiche perteine to our health, and felicitie, he made this the ſumme of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes, that we loue, and healpe one an other with a ſincere herte, and perpetuall beniuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and he requireth verie ſtraitlie that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hert we forgiue one an other mutual of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, which euer more happen thorow the naughtines, and weaknes of our nature, yea and that we ſtudie one to ouercome an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wronges with benifites, and leaue the reuengeaunce to hym, and praye that he wil
<pb facs="tcp:4169:125"/> remitte the ſame to them that hurte vs. He wyll haue ſuche a ſure and perpetuall beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence to growe amonge vs, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with all kindes of gentlenes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer bicauſe no man can aſke of the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie father forgiuenes of his dettes, except he humble him ſelfe al togither vndre his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and vtterly yelde him ſelfe to his commaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dementes, the Lorde hath well preſcribed in this fourme of praying, that we ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe before the heauenlie father, that we woulde forgiue our bretherne what ſo euer dueties or puniſhmentes, they myghte ſeme to be endetted for vnto vs, in that place of prayer, where we pray vnto him to forgiue vs our dettes, whiche we owe vnto him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, either for oure obedience whiche we haue not fullie perfourmed, or for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhmentes that we deſerue both for neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng our dueties, and alſo for the deſpitefull wronges that we do to his maieſtie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge ſo manie thynges againſte the duetie that we owe him.</p>
               <p>Which our dettes if we rightlie acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge, as we muſte needes acknowledge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if we aſke forgiuenes of them with all oure herte, we ſhal not doubt, but that the wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that oure neighbours do vs, be the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlie chaſtiſement of God muche gentler
<pb facs="tcp:4169:125" rendition="simple:additions"/> then we haue deſerued, and that they ſhalbe alſo an holeſome remedie for vs againſte ſynnes. For whiche cauſes it ſhall be eaſie for vs earneſtly to forgiue oure neighbours al offences. Therfore the preachers ſhal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhe the people with ſinguler diligence aboute this place (As we forgiue) alſo that it is not ſuche a maner of forgyuynge, as though we did aſke of God that he woulde ſo forgiue vs our ſynnes, as we forgiue, but that it is a profeſſion of forgiuenes, whiche we alſo make to our detters before the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father, as we require of him to forgiue vs our dettes, as if we ſhoulde ſaye, O hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father forgyue vs oure dettes, as for vs we gladlie remitte, and forgyue al them, that maye ſeme to owe vs anie thinge. For we acknowledge that we ſuffre ſo greuous thinges of no bodie, but that we haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued muche worſe, and therfore we beare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gladly, and forgiue them wyth all our her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes that haue done vs anie harme.</p>
               <p>But bycauſe it is not inough that God forgyue vs our ſynnes and the paynes that we haue deſerued for them, but alſo it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie that we be kepte by him, that Satan drawe vs not afterwarde to ſinnes thorowe ſundrie tentations, the Lorde hath added an other petition for the remouinge of euylles, leade
<pb facs="tcp:4169:126"/> ought not to pray for, which thinge is done more wayes then can be numbred. For the correction of theſe abuſes, thoſe wordes of Paule, Ro. viij. ought to be diligently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and weighed. For we knowe not the thynge that we ſhall praye, as it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, but the ſpirite it ſelfe prayeth for vs wyth vnſpeakeable gronynges. For if we oure ſelues knowe not what, or howe we ſhoulde praye, and if prayer be the propre worke of the holie goſte, it is meete, that the people be called backe to thoſe prayers, that are propouned in the holy ſcriptures, that they maye learne to pray to God according to his wyll, and be certaine that theyr pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be allowed.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde abuſe in prayinge is, when we aſke any thinge of them, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ought not to be aſked, as when men praye ſaintes, whiche nowe lyue wyth the Lorde, that they wyll make interceſſion for them, that they wyl gyue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe thynges that they neede as when they pray S. Sebaſtian to defende them agaynſte arowes, and venimmes. S. Antonie agaynſt the Apoſteme called com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly S. Antonies fyer. S. Appollonie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the touthache. etc. Ite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when they call vpon the Images, and ſtockes of ſaintes, as the ſayntes them ſelues, as they do, whiche
<pb facs="tcp:4169:126" rendition="simple:additions"/> vow pilgrimages to certayn ſtockes, which idolatrie hath welnigh ouerflowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole worlde, and that it maye be taken away the people muſte be diligently called backe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayntes to God, chiefely wyth theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. Fyrſt that there is no commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we ſhoulde cal vpon ſayntes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, wherefore we can be but doubtfull whether that be well done, or no, whether it be acceptable to god, or vnacceptable. And that, that is done with doubtyng, can not be done of fayth, and therefore it is ſynne. For what ſo euer is not of fayth, is ſynne, as S. Paule witneſſeth Ro. viij.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is euident that the prayers that be in the ſcriptures were made of the ſpirite of God hym ſelfe, and came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, and therefore that they be moſt perfecte, and chiefely to be folowed of vs. But in all the ſcripture there is no exemple of ſuche inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation directed to ſayntes, wherfore no man can vſe ſuche a fourme, for therein he ſhal ſet the authoritie of men before the authority of god For he foloweth their authoritie, whoſe exemples he vſeth in prayings, and therfore ſetteth it before the authoritie of the holie goſte. And that is a wonderous greate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite agaynſt the diuine maieſtie. Further if we ſhall vſe the fourme of prayinge, whiche
<pb facs="tcp:4169:127"/> the ſcripture propouneth, the ſame ſhall ſhewe howe muche it is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient to cal vpon ſayntes. For who would not tremble to ſay to ſaynt Petre, or to ſome other of the ſayntes, oure father whiche arte in heauen, whiche kynde of prayinge Chriſte him ſelfe preſcribed vnto vs. For he is not God, he is not our father. Neither can it agree at all, if we would cal vpon S. Petre, or ſome other wyth ſome Pſalme. They then that cal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayntes, do it out of the Imaginations of men. Therefore ſeinge that no man can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the deuiſes of men, before the doctrine, and exemples of the holy goſte wythout a moſte haynous diſpite of God, and ſeinge that al the exemples of praiers deliuered by the holy goſte, teache to cal vpon God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neither is there any, wherein ſayntes be ſpoken vnto, euery man eaſely perceyueth howe vnworthie a thynge it is for chriſten me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which ought to ſeeke the healpe of God wyth true prayers, to vſe thys newe inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of callynge vpon ſayntes, whiche in no wyſe agreeth wyth the doctrine, and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the holie goſte, wherein they refuſe to folowe the rule of the holy goſte, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they ought to ſticke with al reuerence.</p>
               <p>Thyrdly ſuche an abuſe is ſtroungly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected by the worde of God, whiche oure ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
<pb facs="tcp:4169:127" rendition="simple:additions"/> Chriſt layed agaynſt Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Mat. iiij. Thou ſhalte reuerence the Lorde thy God, and him only ſhalt thou worſhyp. And god wyll haue none other Mediatoure, but his ſonne our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. i. Timo. ij. For there is one God, one Mediatoure of God, and men, a man Ieſus Chriſte, whiche hath gyuen hym ſelfe a price of redemption for all. And god witneſſeth that he wil heare for his ſake, and wyll ſo be worſhypped. As we haue a teſtimonie of Chriſte, thou arte a prieſt for euer. Item Math. xi. Come vnto me all ye that faynt, and be laden, and I wil refreſhe you. Iohn. xv. What ſoeuer ye ſhall aſke in my name he ſhall gyue it you. And Ro. ij. Whom God hath ſette forth a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. For therfore our truſt is fixed in Chriſte bicauſe that of hym we haue a promiſe, and commaundement of God, but of the ſaintes we haue no ſuche worde, that God wyll be worſhipped thorowe the inuocation of them or that he wyll heare vs for theyr ſakes. Therefore it is an horrible wyckedneſſe to tranſferre &amp; remoue the truſte due to Chriſt vnto ſayntes wythout the worde, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God. Moreouer that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice is condemned for this cauſe, that it was inſtituted onely by mannes opinion. But in condemny<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> thys abuſe lette the preachers
<pb facs="tcp:4169:128"/> vſe ſuch moderation, that rude men beginne not to thinke, or ſpeake vnreuerently of the ſayntes. For it is one thynge to call vpon ſayntes, and an other, to haue them in reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and honour. We muſte honour them, but we muſte not call vpon them, nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyppe them, whiche thynge yet the comon people do.</p>
               <p>And this is a true honour, and godly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of ſayntes, to prayſe God for that, that he adourned them with ſo godly giftes I meane conſtant fayth, true feare, and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie vertues. Al whiche thynges muſt be ſet before the people, that they may diligently thynke vpon them, and magnifie them, and chiefely prayſe God, and gyue him thankes whiche worketh ſuche thynges in ſayntes. Furthermore they ſhal alſo prayſe the ſain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, which vſed thoſe benifites ſo godly. For thys waye the fayth of Chriſt is confirmed in vs, that God wyll alſo be good vnto vs accordynge to our portion, and there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſteared vp in vs to folowe their exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Thus the olde church worſhypped the ſayntes, which thing appeareth by certayne ſoleme prayers called collectes. For thus the churche prayeth.</p>

                  <p>The thirde abuſe is when the wordes of a prayer otherwyſe godlie, and chriſtian are
<pb facs="tcp:4169:129" rendition="simple:additions"/> drawen to an vngodly and vnlawfull ende, as when thorowe the Lordes prayer we wil ſtaunche bloude, or dryue awaye wolues, that they deuoure not our ſheepe. As ſome go about to wreſt the Pſalme. xxxv. To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyed woundes. Of whiche kinde innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and impieties are vſed of vngodlie enchaunters. Therefore the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſhal warne the people diligently how greuous a ſynne it is, howe great wydked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to abuſe the word of god to ſuch witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craftes, and enchauntmentes. Which abuſe is pernitious, and abhommable, no leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the abuſe of other falſe, and idolatrious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>The fourth abuſe is, when the ende of prayer is peruerted, when men reherſe the wordes of the prayers wyth thys opinion, that they thynke they do acceptable ſeruice to God, and to the ſayntes euen wyth thys worke of reherſyng, whereas we muſt pray to God, not to do hym ſome ſeruice wyth that worke, but that we may call for the free healpe of God, being in daunger of perils, and euyls, whiche we haue deſerued, or that being vnworthie we may receyue benifittes whiche we haue not deſerued. And that we maye praye wyth a fuller feelynge, both of our owne miſerie, and of the diuine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="tcp:4169:130"/> of Chriſte, and wyth feruenter deſire of Goddes healpe, we muſte vſe holy wordes in our prayes. But the comon people hath ben brought into thys errour longe ſithens by vnfaythfull paſtours, that they offre the wordes of the Lordes prayer, of the Angels ſalutation, of the Pſalmes, and other pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, the bleſſed virgin, &amp; other ſayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, as ſome acceptable ſeruice, or gift, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they thinke they deſerue muche of God, and ſayntes, &amp; that they purge their ſynnes and obtayne the benifittes of God. Which abuſe of praying doth not onely fyght with the worde of God, but alſo is foliſhe, and mad euen by the iudgemente of reaſon, and it may eaſely be taken away, if the people be ſo enſtructed of prayer, as we haue ſhewed before.</p>
                  <p>The fyrſt abuſe in prayinge, and no leſſe to be reproued and corrected is thys, that men communely beleue that theyr prayer is more commended to God, and ſoner hearde by reaſon of places, of whiche they thynke ſome to be more holy, then ſome, as if the prayers be made at certaine grauen ſtockes or relikes of ſayntes, or other places, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto men go on pilgrimage, whiche is a greate diſpitefull wronge to the grace and merite of our Lorde Ieſu Chriſte, by whom
<pb facs="tcp:4169:130" rendition="simple:additions"/> onely our prayers be acceptable vnto God, in what place ſo euer they be made, as he hym ſelfe promiſed. Iohn. xv. What ſoeuer ye aſke the father in my name, he ſhall gyue it you. And moreouer he ſayed to the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Samarie. Woman beleue me the houre cometh when ye ſhall worſhippe the father neither in thys hille, nor at Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, God is a ſpirite, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhippe hym in ſpirite, and truth, Iohn iiij. And Mathew. xviij. He ſayeth. If two of you conſente togyther vpon the earth of anie thynge, what ſo euer they aſke, it ſhalbe done vnto them of my father, whiche is in heauen. For where two or three are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red togyther in my name, there am I in the middeſt of them. Lo here the Lorde promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that we ſhall be hearde, if we conſent in prayer, and that he wyl be a meane betwene vs and obtayne al thynges for vs of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo euer, and where ſo euer we ſhall come and agree in his name. Theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes al they diminiſhe, that thynke they ſhall be hearde more certaynly, and ſoner in anie place for the reſpect of grauen ſtockes, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes of ſayntes, or ſome other outward pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of the place. Howebeit it becometh vs to come to the temples, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and it healpeth to praye more deuoutly
<pb facs="tcp:4169:131"/> for this cauſe, that the congregation cometh togyther in thoſe places to prayer, and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are there more ſteared vp to praier thorowe the miniſterie of the worde, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holie exerciſes, and thorowe the very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panie of men prayinge togyther wyth vs. So priuate places haue thys comoditie to prayer, that in them we maye praye wyth a more attentiue minde, and more lifted vp to God. For in theſe places there chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce fewer thynges to call our myndes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thinges that we go about in our prayers. For thys cauſe we reade that the Lorde Ieſus prayed often in mountaynes, and gardines, as he comaunded vs to praye to the father in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete ſhyttynge the chambre. For that oure prayer maye be hearde, no place by it ſelfe healpeth more then other, but the efficacie of prayer leaneth altogyther vpon the merite of Chriſte, and his interceſſion for vs, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a ſure fayth of the promiſes of God, in whiche a beleuing mynde receyueth the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and interceſſion of Chriſte. And where as prayers were wonte to be ſayed amonge the forefathers and holy aſſembles celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, at the ſepulchres of holy martyres, it was done for thys purpoſe, that thorow the remembraunce of the fayeth, whiche ſhined forth ſo goodly in the martyres, the people
<pb facs="tcp:4169:131" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhoulde be more ſteared, &amp; enflamed to pray God to gyue them lyke godlines and fayth and alſo ſhoulde more encourage them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to the ſame. For both the place it ſelfe, and alſo the prayſes of the martyres, which were wonte to be declared wyth the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng of the Goſpell, and vſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, dyd warne, and teſtifie that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the martyres were the gyftes of the free goodnes of God, obteyned vnto them by the merite of Chriſt, and wrought in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thorowe the holie goſte, and therefore ſette before vs that we ſhould aſke the ſame thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father, and truſt to haue them thorowe Chriſte, and the more ſteare vp our ſelues to the deſire of them.</p>

Therefore the paſtours ſhall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour diligently to call the people from this Idolemadnes, and al abuſe of Images, and grauen ſtockes. Firſt then they ſhall teache that there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no vſe of Images vnto chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten men, but when Images are ſette forth, whiche declare true thynges, and ſuche, and after that ſorte, that the remembraunce of thoſe thynges may healpe to ſteare vp faith and prouoke men to the office of godlines. And though there were none other faute, yet thys thinge is moſte vnworthie of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men in the vſe of Images, that liynge Images are ſette forth, whiche offre to the thoughtes of men thynges either playnely or partly fayned, and alſo oftentymes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious and vngodlie. For as they paynt or graue Antonie wyth fyer, and a pigge, Rocke wyth a ſore, whiche the Angel cureth Leonarde wyth a chaine, they are vngodlie faynynges, wherewyth the miſerable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are taught to aſke remedie of Antonie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte the fierie boyle wyth the gyfte of pigges, of Rocke remedie agaynſt the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence wyth gyftes and ſeruice peculiar to hym, of Leonarde eſcapynge or looſynge of
<pb facs="tcp:4169:132" rendition="simple:additions"/> chaines. The temples for the moſte yart are ful of ſuche falſe Images, whiche cauſe and confirme manifeſt vngodlines, and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. Whiche vngodlie Images ſeinge that they oughte to be ſuffered of chriſten men in no place, it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t how vnworthie a thing it is that they be ſeen in te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, where God onely in Chriſt ſhould be preached, and wor ſhipped, and that in ſpirite, and truth. Bokes whiche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teine falſe, and vngodlie doctrines be taken out of the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of chriſten people and that ryghte well, for we muſte auoyed all occaſions of offence. What ſhamefull ſpite is it then to the diuine maieſtie to ſette forth in places dedicated to his name, and ſeruice, a doctrine of ſo manifeſt vngodlines in pictures, and Images, chiefely ſeing that they wyll haue Images to be the bokes of the laye people.</p>
               <p>There is an abuſe alſo of Images, and grauen wodde in this point, that the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaunces of ſayntes are grauen, and made wyth the garmentes, and trimminge of the worlde facioned after the wantonues, and pompe of the worlde, from whiche vanitie, and ryote the ſayntes dyd greatly abhorre. Therefore thorowe thys liynge of Images and grauen ſtockes, the exemples of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, &amp; humiltie, which were in the ſaintes
<pb facs="tcp:4169:133"/> in al their lyfe, and vſe of thynges of thys preſent world, be not onely obſcured, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the contrarie vices are commended. For me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gather that they alſo ſhould deſire thoſe thynges, whiche they ſe to be aſſigned to ſayntes now liuing in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. For euen the Poete Terence perceiued how muche pictures repreſenting naughtie actes wyth ſome commendation do prouoke men to folowe naughtines. For the Poete bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in a yonge man openly declaryng, that he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Further the preachers with lyke dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce oughte to teache the people to forgette the worſhyppnge of grauen wodde, and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that they fall not doune before them, or howe their knees.

For I am the Lorde thy God, a ielous god, whiche puniſhe the iniquitie of the fathers in the chyldren vnto the thirde and forth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore the preachers ſhal warne, and teach the people wyth all diligence, firſt that all they whiche fall doune before Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and grauen wodde, bowe theyr knees and encline theyr heades, or putte of theyr cappes, lyfte vp theyr handes and eyes to them, after the maner of prayinge do open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agaynſt thys commaundement of God.</p>
               <p>Furthermore that they alſo do the ſame, whiche cloth, and decke them, whiche ſenſe them, ſette vp candels, offre, and hange vp giftes, ſing Hymnes, and do them honours and worſhippinges due to God alone, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſaye they are exhibited to ſeeke the ſecrete healpe of God. For peculiar honours, and worſhippynges are due to princes, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable perſonages. For ſo the interpreter of the ſcripture doth tranſlate the worde ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plicare, which ſignifieth to bowe doune hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. But we muſte ſhewe them theſe ſignes of beniuolence, and reuerence, oure mynde euer beholdyng, and worſhippyng the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
<pb facs="tcp:4169:134"/> of God in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſeekyng the healpe of God, not theyr healpe, yea and not onely of them, but by them, and accordynge to the worde of God. But as for Idolles as they feele nothynge, nor be inſtrumentes of anie worke of God, whereunto they myght mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtre wyth theyr wyll, and worke, God would haue no honour gyuen to them. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiche Idolatrie the Apoſtle alſo draweth vs wrytyng to the Cor. Neither be ye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of Images, as ſome of them were.

Further they which attribute ſome ſecrete power of God to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages (as men are wonte to attribute vnto thoſe Images, to whiche they go on pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage) they make them ſelues Goddes of Images, and committe that moſte groſſe wyckednes, whiche God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth euerie wherein the ſcriptures, &amp; alſo in the ſeconde ſentence of the ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes, where he forbiddeth vs to haue, and to worſhyppe ſtraunge Goddes, for whiche alſo in tyme paſte, after the moſte earneſt threates of the prophetes, he puniſhed wyth extreme cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities the Iewes, and other nations, and draue them out of the lande of his promiſe and bountuouſnes. In this vngodlines they

               <p>Therefore the preachers ſhall wyth all poſſible ſtudie call back, diſſuade, and fraye awaye the people from thys ſo deteſtable, and moſte noyſome ſuperſtitions, wycked worſhppynges, and Idolatries, which haue longe time horribly reigned thorow all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of chriſtendome. And for thys purpoſe they ſhall often rehearſe, and declare vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what terrible puniſhmentes God in the law, and the prophetes hath threatened, and throwen vpon them, whiche had wrapped them ſelues in thys abominable acte of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.</p>
               <p>They muſt alſo diligently admoniſhe the people of the daunger of vngodlines, which is euer ioyned with the vſe of images, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe, by whiche thynges, and men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſome commendation of holines are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. For mannes nature is merueilous prone to Idolatrie. Wherefore we ought to ſuſpecte ſo great diligence of makyng Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and grauen ſtockes, and ſettynge them in temples, whiche thynge though it were only done for an ornament, &amp; to prouoke the
<pb facs="tcp:4169:135"/> mindes of the beholders to good thoughtes yet the greate coſte whiche is ſpent aboute ſuche Images, and grauen wodde that feele nothynge, and be the workes of men, is dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen from the lyuely Images, the membres of Chriſte, whiche are Goddes creatures. And moreouer there wanteth not a ſore oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the abuſe it ſelfe. Wherefore ſaynt Epiphanius, whoſe epiſtle ſaynte Herome added to his wrytynges agaynſte Iohn by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe of Hieruſalem, teſtified thus: They haue iudged that it is agaynſt our religion, and the authoritie of the ſcriptures to haue Images in temples. And thys he wrote as the common ſentence of the churche, wherof no man ſhoulde doubte.</p>
               <p>Therefore the preachers ſhall exhort the people, that they rather gette them the holy Bible, whiche thynge they maye do better cheape, then images, that they dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly read the ſame, and that they learne to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wondre at, remembre, and worſhyppe the diuine maieſtie, out of the creation of all thynges, and merueylous gouernaunce of God, and preſeruation, and protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the godly from the begynynge, and puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the wicked, which the bible ſetteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs, rather than to learne the ſame in car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned ſtockes. Further that they be preſent in
<pb facs="tcp:4169:135" rendition="simple:additions"/> the holy aſſembles, heare the treatyng of the worde of God religiouſly, receyue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes godly, and praye faythfully. For God hym ſelfe hath layed theſe thinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs for thys entent, that we ſhould gette preſerue and encraſe in vs thereby know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, loue, and zeale of hym. Wherefore whyle we rightly vſe theſe inſtrumentes of religion, we are ſure that the encraſe of the holie goſte is preſent, and all perill of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition is away, whereas in the vſe of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges daunger wanteth not, as in an inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the holy goſte can not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent wyth them. For howe much ſo euer the diligence of ſetting Images in temples, and the admonition of holy thynges, which they aſſigne to thoſe Images, be decked wyth wordes, and paynted forth, yet it can not be denied, but that what ſo euer can be brought for ſettynge forth of Images and carned wodde in temples, is but the inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche ſomuch is not grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods worde, that God forbadde the olde people ſuche vſe of Images, and the holy fathers in the new people ſuffered it not, whiche thing appeareth playnely out of the deede, and wrytyng of ſaint Epiphanius, whereof we made mention before.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the preachers ſhal diligently
<pb facs="tcp:4169:136"/> teache and warne the people, that it is tyme that we worſhippe, and honour God in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and truth, and that we godly vſe thoſe inſtrumentes, whiche he hym ſelfe hath gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs to ſteare vp thys worſhypping, with religious readynge, and hearynge the holy ſcriptures, and ſermons, whereby the ſame ſcriptures are declared openly, or priuately, moreouer wyth religious vſyng of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuaunce of holy prayers, and alſo wyth a godly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the workes, and iudgementes of God, whiche euer offre them ſelues to oure eyes, to oure handes, to oure myndes, and whiche we euer enioye and take fruite of them, of whiche ſtearynge of oure myndes towardes God, and kendlynge of ſtudie to all the offices of godlines, we haue ſpoken a lytle before in the expoſition of the ſeconde commaundement.</p>
               <p>The godlie preachers ſhal alſo adde this thynge and printe it in the people diligently about thys place, that what outwarde goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſo euer God hath gyuen vs, we muſte beſtowe the ſame vpon the lyuely Images of Chriſte, our neighbours, the membres of Chriſte, that we may feede Chriſte in them, gyue hym drynke, cloth hym, harbour hym, cure hym and comforte hym beinge ſycke,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:136" rendition="simple:additions"/> and ſuccour hym being in bondes. And that we caſte not awaye oure goods in makyng deckyng, clothyng, and honouring Images and carued ſtockes, whiche haue no lyfe, no feelynge, namely wodde, ſtones, metalles, vayne workes of our owne handes. Finally vpon thynges that be abominable to God, as he often wytneſſeth in his prophetes. Which in the laſte iudgement, when he ſhal teſtifie that to be done, or not done to hym what ſo euer we dyd, or omitted to do to the leſte bretherne, that lyued with vs, vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly he ſhal ſpeake terribly vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which neglecting his membres the lyuely Images in pouertie, penurie, and miſeries, haue pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out not theyr owne goodes, but his vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carued ſtockes, and Images, whiche haue no feelyng of ſuche benifittes. Therfore the preachers ſhall diligently go about vtterly to roote out of the mindes of chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people this errour alſo of praying before Images, and ſtockes, and the reſt which we haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For they fight againſt the chiefeſt poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis of the ten commaundementes. And they ſhal teach and declare, and prynt in alwaies thoſe thynges, out of which the people may learne al deuotion to praye to God religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and effectuouſly, and that they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome them ſelues, and ſtycke faſt to that

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to gather the elders together, the ſpouſe, and the ſpouſeſſe, al the inhabitauntes of the
<pb facs="tcp:4169:139" rendition="simple:additions"/> lande into the houſe of God, and crie vnto the Lorde. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth alſo the infantes, and the ſuckelynges to be broughte, that by the ſyght and pitie of them they myghte be moued to greater repentaunce of theyr ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and feruenter prayer for forgiuenes.</p>
               <p>This is the cauſe why God ſo ſore rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Iewes, Eſaie. lviij. Bycauſe on the faſting dayes they regarded theyr buſynes, and required theyr dettes. And he teſtifyeth, that he abhorreth theyr faſtynges, and that they be not thoſe, that he commaunded. In whiche place thys thinge is diligently to be conſidered, that therefore he hearde not their prayers, nor accepted theyr faſtes, bicauſe they folowed theyr owne deſires vpon the faſtyng dayes. Lo, ſayeth he, in your faſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, your wyll is founde. Wherefore it is conuenient that vpon thoſe dayes when fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtynges are preſcribed, the people abſteyne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all other workes, and buſynes, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gyue them ſelues to heare Gods worde, and to praye. For thys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayer of the churche, hath a verie large promiſe propou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Math. xviij. If two of you conſent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vpon earth. etc. Therefore we muſte aſſemble together vnto prayer, and we muſt applie the ſame that we do none other thing and that our hert, and mynde be bent who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:4169:140"/> bent thereunto. Howbeit in priuate faſtes in which the whole congregation is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led togyther to the worde of God, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: honeſte, and moderate labours of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy nothynge hyndre faſtynge, as they hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre not prayer. For the laboure it ſelfe heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth to chaſtiſe the bodie, and to drawe the mynde from the vauinitie of the world, and to moue it to prayer, and alſo to ſuccour the poore. And though at al tymes we muſt vſe labour of the bodie for thys purpoſe, that we may eaſe the neede, of our brethern, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we deſirouſly call for the mercie, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſnes of God. Then let thys ſayinge of Paule haue place: He that hath ſtolen, lette him ſteale no more, but let him rather worke wyth his handes, that he maye ſuccoure the needie. But that faſte that we take vpon vs of carefull deſire to appeaſe, and to praye God, wherof we recited ſome exemples out of the ſcripture, byndeth a man wholy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o prayers, and other exerciſes of religion, and draweth hym from al other cares, and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. As we maye ſe in the faſte of Dauid, whiche he toke vpon hym, his ſonne borne of Bathſeba beinge ſycke, he laye onely in duſte, lamented, and knocked vpon the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God wyth prayers. Paule dyd the ſame thynge in that faſte of three dayes,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:140" rendition="simple:additions"/> when the Lorde had conuerted hym.</p>
               <p>Fourthly the preachers ſhall teache, that large almes muſte be added to a godly faſt, that al vniuſte burthens of our neighbours muſt be looſed, and diſcharged, and that we muſt ſuccour the needie liberally. For ſo the Lorde fayeth, Eſaie. lviij. Shoulde thys be the faſt that I haue choſen, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould daily vexe his ſoule, &amp; wryth his heade lyke a circle, and caſte on ſacke cloth, and aſhes? Wylt thou call thys a faſte, and an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table daye to the Lorde? Is not thys rather the faſte, that the Lorde hath choſen? Looſe vngodly bondes, remitte vſuries vniuſtly oppreſſynge, make them free, that be broken wyth pouertie, and breake all burthens of dettes, breake thy breade to the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>grie, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the needie, and harbourles, when thou ſeeſt the naked, cloth hym.</p>
               <p>For thys cauſe the holie fathers condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all faſtes, as not chriſtian, nor acceptable to God, though neuer ſo ſtraite abſtinence be kept in them and ſharpe chaſtiſyng of the bodie vſed, if they that faſte conuerte not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues from ſynnes wyth all their hertes to the Lorde, and ſettynge aſyde all cares, and buſines of thys lyfe, giue them ſelues who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prayer, and other exerciſes of religion, and vſe moſte liberalitie towardes the pore.
<pb facs="tcp:4169:141"/> Wherfore they taught that they which wil faſte godly ſhoulde beſtowe all that vpon the pore that they had ſpared in faſtynge. whiche is a verie rightfull thynge, and take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the verie nature of godlines. I ſaye that the faythfull whyle they ſtudiouſly cal for the mercie of God, and deſire his libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues alſo at that tyme chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, mercifull, and bountuous to their needie neighbours. For we pleaſe God wyth ſuch ſacrifices. Hebr. xiij.</p>
               <p>Out of thys doctrine of chriſtian faſtes the councell Cabilonenſe enacted that there is required to true faſtyng, that the faſters <note place="margin">The olde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers celebra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſupper of the Lorde on fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtynge dayes at euentyde as ye may ſe in Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us de virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate.</note> be preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at the euening praiers, which done and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion celebrated, and alines di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed, they ſhoulde receyue meate. For the olde fathers celebrated the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the holy euchariſtia, or thankeſgyuynge on faſtinges dayes at eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyde. But thys much of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon faſtyng. For chriſtian men haue a double faſte, a priuate faſte whiche euerie man ioyneth to hym ſelfe, or to his familie onely. And a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon faſte, which the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, or the prouoſtes of the church, inioyne to the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>grega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, and greate neceſſitie that lyeth vpon all men.</p>
               <p>When Dauid bewayled his ſynne, and
<pb facs="tcp:4169:141" rendition="simple:additions"/> prayed that health myght be reſtored to his ſicke ſonne, he kepte a priuate faſte. The faſt of Cornilius was priuate, whereof Luke ſpeaketh, act. x. Item the faſte of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſe. But the faſte of the Niniuites, Heſter, Ioſaphat, and of many other was a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon faſte, which thynge is required Ioell. ij. And an yerely faſte in the daye of purgation, is inioyned. Leuiti. xxiij.</p>
               <p>The holy biſhoppes in olde tyme, and the auncient church kept two maner of theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon faſtes. Some were yerely at certeine and appoynted tymes. Some were not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne, but were vſed accordyng to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie that happened, that they myght be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to prayer. Of the fyrſt ſorte lent is, and other faſtes returning euery yere at certeine dayes, whiche dayly haue bene heaped in numbre wyth mennes traditions, but verie muche hath bene wythdrawen from godlie abſtinence, and religious ſtudie of prayinge to god. For the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the olde churche is longe ſithens corrupted. For the olde by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes diligently exhorted the people to faſte, but they lefte mennes conſcience free, neither condemned them, whiche would not or coulde not faſte. As Paule alſo onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth to faſte, and the Lorde him ſelfe lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no commaundement vpon vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng
<pb facs="tcp:4169:142"/> thys thinge, but taught only how it ſhould be kepte to the acceptation of the father, not of men. In thys moderation of exhortation, and chriſtian libertie, manie wyll faſte god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and truly. Now whereas faſtes be moſt ſtraitly inioyned, no parte of faſtynge or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is kepte, yea the greateſt parte of the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple know not what a true faſte is. And if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie faſte, and chaſtiſe theyr bodies, they do it wyth manifeſte vngodlines, and deſpite of Goddes grace, for wyth that worke they wyll ſatiſfie for theyr ſynnes, and deſerue ſomewhat. Forthermore the fathers conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them openly, whiche were more careful for choyſe of meates, then for true abſtine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and chaſtiſyng of the bodie. And they repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them alſo, which though they vexed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues wyth abſtinence, yet in faſtynge they regarded nothynge elles but abſtinence nor dyd no more. For we muſt faſte for thys en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that we maye be more readie, attentyue and feruent to prayer. Now a daies faſting is thoughte nothynge els, then to abſteyne from the fleſhe of foure foted beaſtes, of bir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des. etc. For they ſerue theyr gul more dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and exquiſitely wyth fiſhes, and other meates vpon faſtyng dayes, then vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other and they take aſmuche at dynner, as myght ſuffice for a good ſupper to. And further
<pb facs="tcp:4169:142" rendition="simple:additions"/> that they maye ſeme accordynge to the olde cuſtome to take meat after the euening prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they haue thoſe prayers before none, <note place="margin">Euenſonge.</note> whiche accordynge to the name ſhoulde be ſayed in the euenyng. What other thynge is thys, then a mocke, and deſpite of the diuine maieſtie. From whiche the preachers muſte diſſuade the people wyth greate diligence, and call them agayne to the true maner of faſtyng, whiche we haue declared. But we wyl determine at a conuenient tyme of the maner of inioynynge, and keepyng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon faſtes, and we wyll vſe ſuche moderation as we truſte ſhall profitte oure people vnto the maynteynyng, and amplifyinge of the ſtudies of godlines, euen as thys muſte be the ende, and marke of all eccleſiaſticall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunces, that they ſerue to the mayntey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng and ſettyng forth of godlines.</p>
               <p>Wherefore as often as there ſhalbe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of treatynge of fayſtynge, either out of the ſcriptures, that ſhalbe expouned, or by reaſon of the tyme appoynted to faſtes, or thorowe ſome other chaunce, the preachers ſhal diligently warne the people of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines and abuſes of faſtes, and ſhall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to corret the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Firſt, and before all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſette no man thynke that he oughte to faſte for thys purpoſe, that he maye deſerue
<pb facs="tcp:4169:143"/> ſomwhat of God wyth that worke, neither let hym be perſuaded that anie faſt, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo hard, is allowed of God, except it be taken vpon vs out of true repentaunce of ſynnes, and a ſure truſte of Goddes mercie to be obteyned for oure Lordes ſake Ieſus Chriſte, that is to ſaye, with a conuerſion to God from the whole hert. Further that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng be ſo ordeyned, and kept, that it ſerue to true, and godly humblynge, chaſtiſynge. and ſanctifyinge of the bodie, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite maye be readier to prayer, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of religion. Thys is a godlie and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable faſt, wherunto the preachers muſt buſily exhorte the people.</p>
               <p>And cheiefly the preachers ſhall call the people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that vngodlines, thorow whiche ſome faſte vnto ſayntes, either of inioyned ſatiſfaction, as they call it, or of theyr owne wylles, or that they maye obteine with that worke certeyne benifittes of the ſayntes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, or that they may haue theyr interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before God for certeyne benifittes. For as we ſayed before, chriſtian taſtyng is a cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teyne preparation of a true, and faythfull prayer vnto God, thorow Chriſt our Lorde and not a worke wherewyth God is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhypped by it ſelfe, muche leſſe wherewyth we might deſerue anie thyng at the ſayntes
<pb facs="tcp:4169:143" rendition="simple:additions"/> handes. For wyth faſtyng we humble oure ſelues, and pray for remiſſion of ſynnes, and <note place="margin">Origene in Leui. Ho. x. Chap. xvi.

               <p>And foraſmuche as the true maner of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng is ſo muche corrupted, and exceſſe in meates, and drynkes ſo much encreaſed, that ſome on the faſtynge dayes wyll abſteyne verie ſtraitly from meate, and ſome tymes from drynke to, vſynge onely water, whiche the next daye, and on the verie holie dayes of the ſaintes, whereunto they prepared the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues wyth faſtynge, are not aſhamed to drynke tyll they be dronken, &amp; to lyue ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, the preachers (whiche thinge the holie fathers dyd alſo) ſhall chiefely beate in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſynnes, and all exceſſe, and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſures, and they ſhall exhorte them to moderation, and temperance of lyfe, whiche thynge we reade that the Apoſtles did alſo, Thus the people at length ſhal be broughte to true and godly faſtyng.</p>

For which cauſe God commaunded the fathers alſo in the olde teſtament, that at thoſe three yerelie feaſtes, in which al the males ſhould appeare in his ſyght, they ſhoulde not come emptie before him, but that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould offre accordynge to his abilitie of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynge, that euerie one had receyued of the Lorde, Exod. xxij. and Deut. xv.

               <p>Out of theſe places of the ſcripture, and inſtitution of the olde churche the preachers ſhall teache the people, fyrſte that the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſte is that onely propitiatorie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, of good ſauour, whiche by it ſelfe is accepted to God the father, and deſerueth
<pb facs="tcp:4169:146" rendition="simple:additions"/> vnto vs forgyuenes of ſynnes, grace, and other benifittes of God, and that it is the ſacrifice which was ſhadowed in al the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fices of the law, &amp; whiche made al the other acceptable vnto God. As alſo the ſacrifice of our ſelues, and what ſo euer pleaſaunte thynges we can do to God, be allowed, and accepted of God for reſpecte of thys onely propitiatorie ſacrifice. Without Chriſt there is nothynge acceptable. No man can do any acceptable thynge wythout Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the preachers muſte buſely beate into the people that they thynke not, that, acceptable ſeruice, or worſhyppe maye be done vnto God, with any ſacrifice or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation be it neuer ſo precious, for the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and worthines either of the thynge, or of the offerer, if the ſame ſacrifice, or oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be not offered, and made acceptable in Chriſte the Lorde thorowe his merite.</p>
               <p>Secondly that they go not about to giue any other ſacrifices to God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe which we rehearſed before, that is to ſay, the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of them ſelues, of a bruſed ſpirite, and herte afflicted thorowe ſynnes.

And therefore the people muſt be warned, that corporal goodes muſt be offered to God for none other vſe, then that the religion of Chriſte maye be furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the holie miniſterie maye be ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and maynteyned, that the neceſſitie of the pore maye be prouided for.

               <p>Therefore to buylde huge temples, and to decke them wyth more thynges, then be requiſite to thys purpoſe, that the congrega<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion maye haue a comelie place, whereunto they maye come togyther to heare Goddes worde, to receiue the ſacramentes, and to do other thinges perteynyng to religion, is not allowed of God.

Timo. i. Therefore lette the thynge that S.

The matter ſtode otherwiſe with the people of the olde teſtament, wich had theyr peculiar rites, theyr ceremonies, theyr poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, their orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes in the tabernacle, and in the temple, all whiche thynges after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng of Chriſte, ceaſed. That people had onely one temple, whiche they decked wyth ſome outwarde gorgiouſnes, &amp; in the meane whyle neuertheles they were commaunded that they ſhoulde haue no begger amonge them. Deut. xv.</p>
               <p>In the daye of iudgemente when Chriſte
<pb facs="tcp:4169:148"/> ſhall pronounce the laſte ſentence of al men, he ſhall ſay thus. I haue hungred, thyrſted, I was naked, a ſtraunger, weake, in bondes and you miniſtered vnto me. For what ſo euer ye dyd to one of theſe litleones, I take it to be done vnto my ſelfe, entre therefore into the kyngedome of my father, whiche was prepared for you from the begynning. But to thoſe, whiche haue not done theſe thynges to his litleones, he ſhall ſaye. Go into euerlaſtyng fyer. etc. But we ſhal heare no mention made of buyldyng of temples, and monaſteries, and deckynge of the ſame. Let the paſtours then teach the people to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite true worſhippynges vnto God, to decke his true, and liuely temples, that is to ſuccour the pore and afflicted, whiche be the true membres, and bretherne of Chriſte.</p>
               <p>Thys thynge God hym ſelfe dyd not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commaunde vs, but the holie fathers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo require the ſame of vs. S.

When the Lorde ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playne, and require why the goodes of the churche, golde, and coſtlie veſſels were not beſtowed vpon the vſe of the pore, and redemyng of priſoners, if a man wyll laye the ornamentes of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for his excuſe, and ſaye, I was a feard leſt the temple of God ſhoulde want orna<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes,

The raunſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of priſoners, is the verie orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cramentes, and they be verie precious veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles, whiche redeme ſoules from death. That is the true treaſure of the Lord, which worketh the ſame thynge, that his bloude wrought. Then (ſayeth he) I acknowledge the veſſel of the Lordes bloud, when the cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lice redemeth them from the enemie, whom the bloud redemed from ſynne. etc. But our naturall blyndnes, and rebellion agaynſte God, cauſeth, that we neuer worſhyppe him according to his preſcription. And tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe our naturall pryde, and vngentlenes, and neglectyng of our bretherne, it cometh to paſſe, that we thinke thoſe thynges vayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſted, and loſte, or not well beſtowed, whiche are ſpent vpon the needie, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed men before the worlde. Therefore men fall ſo farre, that they had leuer offre theyr gyftes to God for an ornament of wodde, ſtones, and deade bones, and for the mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinaunce of vnprofitable felowes, then for the vſe of the pore, where as yet he teſtifieth that he wyll compte thoſe thinges done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him ſelfe, what ſo euer we beſtowe vpon
<pb facs="tcp:4169:149"/> the pore for his ſake, promiſyng that he wyl recompence the ſame in thys worlde, and in the worlde to come.</p>
               <p>Wherefore thys falſe, and peruerſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the fleſhe muſte be earneſtly rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and diligently corrected, that they maye omitte thoſe ſacrifices vnacceptable to god, and that they ſuccour the needie, and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perſones wyth true ſacrifices, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God. And the preachers muſt teach and exhorte the people diligently, that they brynge all their gyftes, and oblations into a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon treaſurie of the churche, and that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berallie. And they ſhall declare moreouer that this is the deutie not onely of the riche, but alſo of all men, after the meaſure of the goodes, whiche the Lorde hath graunted to euerie one of them. For Chriſte offered him ſelfe for al men, no leſſe for the pore, then for the riche. It becometh then al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and to remembre that pore wydowe whiche by the iudgement of Chriſte in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge of a farthynge gaue more into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>We alſo, God wyllyng, ſhall take ſuche ordre for the makynge of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon treaſurie of the churche, wherwyth not onely the pore and beggers ſhal be ſuccurred, but alſo ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendes ſhall be appoynted for certayne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde

               <p>Wherefore the preachers ſhal diligently exhort the people, that they offre their obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Lorde liberally, as often as they come togyther to heare the Lordes worde, to the holie baptiſme, to the receyuynge of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the ſupper of the Lorde, to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayers, or on the ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dayes, and other accuſtomed feſtes, when mariages are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when thankes are gyuen to the Lorde for them, which haue recouered them ſelues from ſome ſyckenes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> women lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered go to churche, and when ſo euer god hath gyuen peculiar gyftes to men, whiche thynge he doeth euen dayly.

For it is a great, and an vngodlie vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kefulnes, that whereas men beſtowed ſo manie thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges moſt liberally vpon ſtones, wodde, and dead mennes bones, vpon ſtationaries, and ſuch other vnprofitable fellowes, and were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to bye ſacramentes and other ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall

Therefore the people muſt be called by the preachers with greate diligence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe ſuperſtitious oblations whiche they were wonte to offre vnto dead ſayntes, theyr ſtockes, and relikes, and they muſte be enſtructed, and exhorted to true, and acceptable ſacrifices vnto God, wherof we haue ſpoken.</p>

               <p>An other kynde of vngodlie doctrine, wherewyth the Anabaptiſtes fight agaynſt the congregation of Chriſte, is concernyng ſpirituall matters.

<pb facs="tcp:4169:169"/> triflynge, or chyldiſhe thynge is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in thys holie adminiſtration, wherein warre is taken in hande agaynſte Satan, wherein he is not onely dryuen out of the infant, but the infant is bound with an othe, that he euer warre agayng hym, as the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of his kynge Chriſt vnto his laſt breath wyth all his power. Wherefore God muſt be called vpon wyth greate confidence, and moſte feruent prayers, that he wyll not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliuer thys chylde from the power of Satan, but alſo ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthen, and defende hym that thorowe out all his lyfe, and chiefely in the poynt of death, he maye ſtande, &amp; fyght agaynſt Satan valiauntly.</p>
               <p>Wherefore lyfte ye vp your myndes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and thynke that you muſte in thys place heare the worde of God wyth ſinguler de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, that you muſte call vpon God with lyuely fayth, and that here you are prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to prayer for a moſte weightie cauſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore behaue your ſelues ſo, that God maye ſe your religion, and allowe it, neither ſuffre ye that thys moſte holie Sacramente of Baptiſme, be vnworthelie handled tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe you, and be made a mocke vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and ſo ſhame be done to God, whiche here powreth forth ſo greate ryches of his grace. For he hym ſelfe calleth thys Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:169" rendition="simple:additions"/> the lauer of regeneration, whereby he maketh vs his owne ſonnes, heyres of euerlaſtynge lyfe, and part takers of all his benifittes, bycauſe we be the coheyres of his Chriſte, beinge deliuered from the tirannie of the diuell, ſynne, death, and hell. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beſeche you for Gods ſake, and your ſaluation, that ye wyll worthely eſteme and thankefully embrace ſo wonderfull abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt grace of God, whiche is exhibited in thys Sacrament. For Baptiſme is a greate comforte vnto vs in oure daungers, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and it is the fyrſte entraunce vnto all the benifittes of God, and to the bleſſed feloſhyppe of all ſaintes.</p>
               <p>Therefore that we maye conſidre thys vnſpeakeable benifitte of God wyth a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter minde, and greater religion, we muſt fyrſte remembre, into howe greate euyls the fall of Adam thrue vs. And contrariewyſe how vnmeaſurable grace God exhibited to mankynde thorow his ſonne in that, that he hath redemed vs from the ſame euylles by baptiſme. Thirdly howe thys ſo great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God ought to be euer before our eyes in all perilles, and with howe great prayſes we ſhould magnifie the grace of god, which we haue receyued thorowe baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Fyrſte then we muſte conſidre wyth all
<pb facs="tcp:4169:170"/> diligence, that all we thorowe the ſynne of Adam, and enuie of Satan, be ſubiect to the wrath of God, and moreouer damned, and be holden priſonners vnder the power, and kyngdome of the diuell, vndre death, ſynne, and hell, ſo that we being by nature the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, coulde appeaſe God by no ſtrength of man, no vertues, or workes. For all that is in vs, and all our workes be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of God, and ſubiecte to the tirannie of Satan, by reaſon of our corrupted nature.</p>
               <p>For ſeinge that thorowe the inobedience of our fyrſt Adam (of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are all borne into this natural, and earthlie lyfe) we come al into the worlde giltie, and curſed of God ſo that we muſte all dye in hym, and beare his earthie Image in thys mortall bodie, it feloweth, that all our lyfe, and all the dedes of our nature ſo corrupted, be condemned of God, though they appeare neuer ſo godlie, and holie before men. For what ſo euer is borne of fleſhe, is fleſh, that is to ſay, ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge from God, repugning to the ſpirite, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged to death, and hell. Wherefore fleſhe and bloud ſhal not atteine to the kyngdome of God. For whatſoeuer is fleſhe, it ſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth fleſhely thynges, and ſo lyueth, it is an aduerſarie to God, for it is not ſubiecte to the lawe of God. Wherefore they that be
<pb facs="tcp:4169:170" rendition="simple:additions"/> fleſhely can not pleaſe God, the wyſedome of the fleſhe is death. And therefore oure Lorde Chriſte diſputyng wyth Nicodemus concludeth thus. Verely, verely I ſaye vnto the, excepte a man be borne agayne of water and of the ſpirite, he can not entre into the kyngdome of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly we muſt conſidre, howe plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull the grace of God gyuen to vs in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, is, wherin his bountuouſnes, and loue towardes men, truly appeareth in aſmuche as he hath ſaued vs, not thorowe the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of ryghtuouſnes, whiche we had done, but accordyng to his mercie, by the lauer of regeneration, and renouation of the holie goſt. For he, thorow the vertue of his worde waſheth awaye, and aboliſheth whatſoeuer maketh vs giltie, and condemneth vs, as in olde tyme, he drouned in the redde ſea, the enemies of his people, and deſtroyed al ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde wyth the floude, eyghte ſoules reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, whiche were ſaued in the arke. So this lauer of water ſaueth vs, thorow the word, not in waſhyng away the fyl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h of the fleſhe as it chaunſeth in all other waſhynges, but thorowe the certification of a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience towardes God, by the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ieſus Chriſt. For by the vertue of Goddes coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt we are cleanſed in our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, and
<pb facs="tcp:4169:171"/> we are certified both thorow the worde, and an outwarde ſigne, that all the ſynnes that defiled, and condemned vs, be playnly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, bycauſe they be forgyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and be dead. Therfore thorowe baptiſme, we determine certeynly, that we are acceptable vnto God and ioyned vnto hym wyth an euerlaſtyng couenaunt of grace, ſo that nothynge can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym, or condemne vs. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore henſforth we muſte not onely eſchewe ſynnes, but alſo feare them, and abhorre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, none otherwyſe then from hel, as men dead vnto ſynnes. For all we, as S. Paule wytneſſeth, whiche be baptiſed into Chriſte Ieſus, be baptiſed into his death, for we are buryed wyth hym into death. Therfore we be dead to ſynne, and to the whole olde ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and broughte forth in Chriſte ſo farre, that nothynge can condemne vs, or ſeperate vs from the grace of God. For he that is deade is iuſtified from ſynne, he is no more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte to the tirannie of ſynne, death, and hell, though he feele the remnauntes of ſynne in the fleſhe, yet thoſe be not imputed vnto co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation by reaſon of the iuſtification of the ſpirite in Chriſte.</p>
               <p>Furthermore Baptiſme worketh a newe lyfe in vs, and acceptable to God. For as Chriſte was reyſed from the deade, by the
<pb facs="tcp:4169:171" rendition="simple:additions"/> glory of the father, ſo he worketh in vs with his ſpirite, that we alſo maye walke in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of lyfe. For if we be grafted in hym by the lykenes of his death, ſurely we ſhal alſo be part takers of his reſurrection vnto euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtyng lyfe, knowinge thys that oure olde man is crucified wyth him, that the bodie of ſynne ſhould be aboliſhed, that hereafter we ſerue not vnto ſynne.</p>
               <p>Wherfore let vs reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pte that we be dead to ſinnes in dede, and liue to God in Chriſt our Lorde, in whom alſo we be circumciſed wyth a circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſion made wythout handes, whyle we put of the bodie of ſynnes, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſion of Chriſt. We are buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wyth hym thorow baptiſme, wherein we haue alſo ryſen agayne wyth hym, by the fayth of the workynge of God. For God whiche rayſed Chriſte from the deade, hath quickened vs with him, euen when we were dead thorowe ſynnes, by the vncircumciſion of the fleſhe, or fleſhly lyfe. For though our lyfe be hidden in God with Chriſt, yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſte our lyfe ſhall appeare, then ſhall we alſo in hym be manifeſted in glorie, as men, whom God of his exceadyng mercie, hath begotten agayne into a lyuely hope, thorow the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſte from the dead, vnto (I ſaye) an incorriruptible inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:172"/> vndefiled, and that fadeth not away, not of corruptible ſeede, but vncorruptible, namely the lyuely worde of God, by which worde baptiſme conſiſteth, and worketh all the forſayed thynges in vs truely, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuouſly.</p>
               <p>Thyrdly we ſhall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort our ſelues with ſo great excellencie of the grace of God, and benifittes beſtowed vpon vs thorowe bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and we ſhall euer thanke God, and that ſo muche the more ſtudiouſly, as we ſhall be oppreſſed, wyth more greuous cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, confirmynge our fayth hereby, that God worketh in vs, mortifieth the olde ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and repayreth the newe, though not after a viſible ſorte, yet by the vertue of baptiſme thorowe the worde, and the ſpirite. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lette vs confirme oure conſciences, and thynke that God careth for vs, and that for the merite of his ſonne, we be acceptable, and deare to hym, and when we be exerciſed wyth aduerſitie, and ſundrie miſeries, we muſt reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, that we are baptiſed, and that in baptiſme al our ſinnes, &amp; euils be ouerco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and deade, and that they be dayly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and oboliſhed more and more thorowe the croſſe and ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry afflictions, which God ſendeth vnto vs, and that the newe man is continually renued and repared thorow the

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that we maye cleaue faſter and lyne more fully in hym, and he in vs.</p>
               <p>And foraſmuch as the Lorde, when he iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted thys holie ſupper, dyd ſaye. Do thys in remembraunce of me, the preachers ſhall diligently warne thys alſo, that the Lorde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, that we ſhoulde do thoſe thynges in this Sacrament, whiche he hym ſelfe ſhewed to be done by his exemple.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4169:194"/>
               <p> Therefore we muſte ſet the ſame acte of the Lorde before vs, neither muſte we in any wyſe decline from the ſame, or chaunge any thynge of it, though an Angel from heauen, or an Apoſtle did counſel and bidde vs ſo to do. Which thinge the right holy biſhop, and martyr Ciprian, gathereth well and truely out of theſe, and many other wordes of the Lorde. For if Chriſt be our onely Lorde, and maiſter, we as the miniſters, and diſciples of hym muſte needes folowe and do, not the worde or dede of anie man, or Angel, but we muſte folowe, and do wyth al reuerence the thynges that he dyd, and layed before vs to do, neither maye we regarde, what other dyd before vs, but what Chriſte oure Lorde fyrſte dyd, whiche is before al thynges. And al they that do not thys, but chaunge ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the inſtitution of the Lorde in thys moſte holie miſterie, ought not to be iudged his vicares, or his prieſtes, ſeing that for the traditions of men, they caſte away the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of Chriſte. The holie martyr wryteth theſe, and muche moore ſeuere and earneſte thynges in the ſame Epiſtle, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte them, that in the adminiſtration of this moſt holy Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t chaung any point of that the Lorde hym ſelfe did in his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. For he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded vs to do that onely.
<pb facs="tcp:4169:194" rendition="simple:additions"/> Nowe if we conſider howe Chriſte inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this holye ſupper, it appeareth clearelie out of the declarations of the euangeliſtes, and ſaynt. Paull, that firſt he made his holie ſupper with his diſciples, and that he made the ſame, one, and commune to al that were preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and with ſuche diſciples, as had who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye gyue theym ſelues to hys doctrine. For thoughe Iudas were a fayned diſciple, and as Chriſt calleth him a diuyll, neuertheles, the other diſciples dyd not yet knowe that, for he dyd cleane to the Lorde in outwarde profeſſion, and lyfe, as the reſt did.</p>
               <p>But the Lorde, whan he gaue his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, an exemple in hys ſupper, where as he admitted Iudas, he would not followe hys owne ſecret iudgement, but that open &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which his diſciples might, &amp; ſhoulde folowe afterwarde.

               <p>Therefore for thys verye cauſe, that the Lord conmanded vs to do that, in his holie ſupper, that he himſelfe dyd, and he celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it wyth thoſe hys diſciples only, whych had wholy giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to hys doctrine, and euer folowed hym, and celebrated one ſupper only, the prechers ſhal obſerue two thynges.

For thus the lord ſayeth Iohn. iij. If ye abyde in my worde, ye are my diſciples in deade. But they that wyll declare themſelues to be faythful miniſtres of the Lorde, in the adminiſtracion of theſe miſteries, ſhall not admitte anie other to the lordes ſupper, but ſuch as be tried, and haue confeſſed before the congregacion, that they haue giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to the Lorde, and haue proued the ſame with theyr life, as the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:4169:196" rendition="simple:additions"/> alſo celebrated the ſupper wyth choſen diſci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ples. Secondly that in one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the faythfull, one ſupper be miniſtred, and that the paſtour himſelf celebrate it, if he may by anie meanes, at ſuch tyme whan the whole congregacion is wont to come together, as vpon ſondayes, and holye dayes, if ſo be there ſhalbe preſent, that wyl communicate, as men, that be one bodye, and one breade of Chriſt, and are ſo outwardly alſo ioyned together of the Lord that thei pertain to one congregacion, and paſtoral cure, and receiue the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lord out of one bread, and one cuppe.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde thynge that the Lorde dyd in his ſupper, is this, he gaue thanges to the father, and that in ſuch language, as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciples might vnderſtand al thinges, and be ſterred vp wyth hym to prayſe God. For whyche cauſe the paſtours ſhall warne the people, firſte, that in the adminiſtracion of thys ſacrament, we muſt gyue thankes to God throughe oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, for al the benifites that he hath gyuen, and giueth to vs dayly, and cheifely for that be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifite, out of whyche al other come, and be made true benifites vnto vs, I meane, that he ſo loued vs, that he gaue vs hys ſonne a redemer, that, all that beleue in him ſhoulde

               <p>Secondly that the prieſte, and miniſtre of this ſacrament in gyuinge thankes to God, giueth thankes in his owne name, and in the name of the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregacion wherfor the people muſt lyft vp theyr mindes, and herke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the thinges, that are ſpoken of the prieſt, that thei maye praiſe, and thanke God toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the preiſt.

<pb facs="tcp:4169:199"/> the paſtours ſhall warne this alſo, that men excludyng the iudgement of theyr owne reaſon, geue fayth ſimply to the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des wordes, and that they ſtudy to receyue this heauenly meat, and this bleſſed commu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion of our onelye ſauioure and Lorde with ſinguler deſire, and thankfulnes of mynde.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the preachers ſhall diligentlye warne the people, that they erneſtly conſidre thoſe moſt bleſſed wordes of the Lord, which is geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for you, which is ſhed furth for you and for many vnto the forgeuenes of ſinnes Item this is the newe teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in my bloud or this is the bloud of the newe teſtamente.

               <pb facs="tcp:4169:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p> The fourth thinge that the Lorde deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and dyd in his holye ſupper is this, that he ſaide, Do this in the remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of me. And he gaue manie other holſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes to his diſciples, and exhortacions. For he taught the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and warned them afore hande wyth manye wordes, of hys paſſion, and the fruit that we receyue by the ſame, of his reſurrection and heauenly kingdome, of the office, and miniſterie of chriſten men, and chiefely of theyr apoſtolike offyce to preach hys kingdome in al the world, and together in to it the ſcatered children of God, and to confirme and further them in the ſame. For this cauſe than the preachers ſhal warne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, as often as this ſacrament is mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, that thei muſt ſtudiouſly ſtirre vp, and celebrated the remembraunce of Chriſte by godlye, and diligente handelynge, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel, whereby thei ſhal faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fully declare to the people, how neceſſarie it was for vs that the ſonne of God ſhoulde take oure fleſh, and with hys death deliuer vs from eternall death, and the terannye of Satan, and howe greate benifites he obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and gaue vs, and dayly gyueth vs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ought hys death, and reſurrection, that is to wit remiſſion of ſinnes, the ſpirite of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a newe, and bleſſed powre of liuinge,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:200"/> the felloſhippe of reſurrection vnto a verie heauenlye, diuine, and euerlaſtinge lyfe. All whiche thinges muſte be muſte religiouſly preached, and conſidered in the holie ſupper.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in this muſt hollie action the doctrine of the Goſpell, and the lawe muſte be diligently beaten in, that the Lordes death and reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and al thinges, that he was made for vs, that he dyd and ſuffred, that he obteyned for vs, and perfourmed and dayly perfourmeth, be muſte ſtudyouſly preached and that the remembraunce of him be fully, and perfectly celebrated, to this end that our fayth in him, and new and bleſſed lyfe in the lame, maye be euer confirmed, and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Therefore we vſe yet of the cuſtome of the olde church, that open, and principal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons be made a boute this miniſtracion of the holye maſſe.</p>
               <p>The paſtours, and teachers of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>grega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions ſhall often and faythfully warne, and enſtructe the people of all theſe thinges. So the choſen of God ſhal eaſly ſuffer them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to be led awaye from al abuſes of thys moſt reuerende and holie ſacramente and be brought agayne to the true, and holſome vſe of the ſame. For the ſhepe of Chriſte knowe the voyce of theyr ſhepeherde, and folowe him hertely. This maner ſurly canne not be

All chriſtiane Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine conſiſteth herein, and is grounded her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, that men be taught to kepe all thoſe thinges, that oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, as the father hym ſelfe witneſſed of hym from heauen, ſayinge, Thys is my welbeloued ſonne, here him.

               <p>But it is euident that this our only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and Lorde, inſtituted the ſacramente of thanckes gyuinge wyth theſe wordes, and commended it vnto vs. Do this in the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Who is he than, whiche beinge well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed hereof, wil not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude furthwith that al they that wil chriſtianely, and hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely handle this ſacrament, muſt conſider and folowe (as S.

That the grace of God is gotten to them, and all bliſfulnes, though thorowe theyr whole lyfe, they be agaynſte God, and abuſe all thynges agaynſt God and that wythout anie earneſt thoughte of repentaunce.

For thus it is in Paule, I receyued of the Lorde that, that I deliuered alſo vnto you. But the Apoſtle deliuered to the whole congregation of the Corhinthians the communion aſwell of the
<pb facs="tcp:4169:203" rendition="simple:additions"/> cup, as of the breade. Wherefore ſome make a raſhe, and a lyght argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that the Lorde in his ſupper gaue the whole Sacrament to his Apoſtles, whiche were all prieſtes, and that we can not gather therof, that the cuppe muſt be alſo gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the lay me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For in thys Sacrament, ſaith S. Chriſoſtome, and that out of the teſtimonies of the holie ſcripture, the prieſtes haue nothyng more, then the lay men, but all thynges are commune to both, and one breade of the Lorde, and one cuppe, is ſette before al men togyther, and equally. Thus the Lorde inſtituted, thus the olde churche obſerued alwayes. Therefore none other thynge coulde be inſtituted of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dyd the fathers euer inſtitute anie other thynge. But in theſe later tymes, when the gouernours of congregations dyd vtterlie neglecte theyr office, thys abuſe crepte in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretely, that in the holy ſupper the Lordes breade onely ſhould be diſtributed, whether prieſtes or laye men dyd communicate.</p>
               <p>But that all the abuſes, that haue crepte into thys Sacrament maye be vtterly take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, and rooted vp, by the true vſe of thys Sacrament, whiche the Lorde hym ſelfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, the paſtours and preachers ſhall diligently warne, and exhort the people, that as often as they come togyther to the holie
<pb facs="tcp:4169:204"/> ſupper of the Lorde with the bretherne, they gyue them ſelues wholy to the Lorde, to be his diſciples, that they thynke that all his wordes be ſpoken vnto them, and that they beleue them certeynely, that they feruently deſire the communion of the Lorde to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in them, and that they receyue the ſame offered in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wyth a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and thankeful minde, briefely that they euer go forwarde in the faith of Chriſt, and in the whole newe lyfe wyth Chriſt, neither ſtande there as diſpiſers of ſo great gyftes, whiche in the holie ſupper be offered to all that are preſent, nor make to them ſelues an hurtfull ſpectacle of a bleſſed teaſte. Surely he that is not meete to receyue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not meete neither to praye wyth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, as S. Chriſoſtome doth right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gather. Thys Sacrament is not only the meate of the ſtronger, but alſo the medicine of the weake, onely lette no man receyue it, whiche ſticketh in ſynnes agaynſte his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. For he that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth in ſuch ſinnes, wyll not lyue in Chriſte the Lorde, he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his communion in dede, and vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth Chriſt and his kyngdome. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt abſteyne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes in whiche the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of Chriſte is exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.

<pb facs="tcp:4169:204" rendition="simple:additions"/> of hell, and haue no parte in the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſte. Wherfore they can neither be preſent, nor ought to be preſent at the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſupper, nor pray wyth the congregation. For no man that determineth to continue in open ſynnes, and in the deſpite of God, can call vpon God his father wyth true fayth, and praye for the ſanctification of his name, the commyng of his kyngdome, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his wyll.

                  <p>It was the maner of the olde church, and that taken out of Goddes worde, that after the preachyng of the Goſpell, before the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhould beginne, not onely thoſe ſhoulde be commaunded to go out of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, whiche were not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, nor perteined there vnto, but they alſo whiche were yet in repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, and not reconciled to the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wyth open abſolution of ſinnes. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bycauſe thys diſcipline was taughte of the Lorde hym ſelfe, and oughte of ryghte to be called agayne into the congregation, the paſtours ſhall diligently, and often exhorte thoſe, whiche lyue in ſuche ſynnes, as be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theyr conſcience, that they leaue them and turne them ſelues wyth all theyr hertes vnto the Lorde. And after that they be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:4169:222"/> into the fauour of God, and begynne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to be the true diſciples of the Lorde, then lette them be preſent at the Lordes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and communicate.</p>
                  <p>But if anie will not ſuffre them ſelues to be brought thereunto, and wyll continue in theyr ſynnes wyth ſo great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of God and his Chriſte, let the preachers declare to ſuche, that they maye not be preſent at the Lordes holie ſupper, and if they take vpon them to be preſent, that they do deſpite vnto Chriſte, and prouoke vpon them ſelues the muſte greuous iudgement of God. As for other whiche lyue not wyth an euyll conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and yet receyue not the ſacramet wyth other, or ſeldome receiue it: the paſtour muſt often warne them, that it perteyneth to the dutie of a chriſten man, to be often partaker of the Lordes bourde, and ſo to feede, and ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthen his fayth, and to witnes the ſame vnto the congregation to the edification of many, ſeinge that God hath inſtituted thys moſte holie exerciſe of religion for his, that they myght therby be eſtabliſhed and enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in fayth, and ſtudy of godlines. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee that they, whiche neglect ſo great a benifite of God, become dayly colder in al godlines, and religion. For they greuouſly offende God thorowe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſnes,
<pb facs="tcp:4169:222" rendition="simple:additions"/> and they hurt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſore wyth that euyll exemple, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer they make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues giltie of the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des bodie and bloude, abhorryng this meate and drynke of euerlaſtynge lyfe, ſo irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſo vnthankefully.</p>
                  <p>But foraſmuch as both the knowledge of thys miſterie, and moreouer al the diſcipline of the congregation, is ſo much gone out of vſe, and therof cometh ſo great weakenes of the verie faythful: the paſtours muſt reſtore to the people, the knowledge &amp; exiſtimation of ſo greate miſteries, wyth conuenient and tymelie admonition, and not trouble anie man wyth vntimely rigorouſnes, as we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed before. For firſte the ſheepe of Chriſte ſo miſerably ſcatered, and diſeaſed, muſte be fully broughte to Chriſte, and be healed, before that any rigorous diſcipline be reſtored, and exerciſed amonge them. But howe ſo euer the reſt be handled in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation at thys tyme, they neuertheles that ſhall be admitted to the communion, as ſone as they haue made theyr oblation, muſt go together to that place, that ſhall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted vnto them, nigh to the altare. For in euerie temple, there muſte ſome place be appoynted nigh the altare for them, whiche ſhal communicate, accordyng to the oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<pb facs="tcp:4169:223"/> and fitnes of euerie temple.

               <p> As for vs, we wyl not take from any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his right of appoyntyng curates to congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.

               <p>Howbeit we muſt not thinke, that Chriſt wyth thys notable miracle woulde ſignifie, that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after foure dayes ſhal be ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp to this temporall and mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine life as Lazarꝰ was, but with this acte he would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme and eſtabliſhe the truth of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, whiche he comprehended in thys place with fewe wordes, and as it were in a ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me ſaiyng, I am the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and lyfe, he that beleueth in me though he be deade, he ſhall lyue, and euery one that lyueth, and beleueth in me, ſhall not dye for euer.</p>

As Paule teſtifieth, Chriſt is riſſen from the deade, he was the firſt fruite of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that had fallen a ſleepe. For ſeing that death came by man, the reſurrection of the dead, cometh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by man. For as by Adam all men dye, ſo by Chriſte al men be quickened. etc.</p>
               <p>Wherfore the death of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche cleane to the body of Chriſte thorowe fayth, ought not to be compted ſuche, as ſhoulde haue ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth to deſtroye and condemne, but ſuche as before God is compted precious, and is, as it were entroniſed, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated of Chriſt to be the dore, and entry into euerlaſting life Though the bodie then beinge buried in the earth, vaniſhe away, and be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded from the eyes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet God, which is almightie preſerueth the life of it.

               <p>This is a diuinite, and an vnchaungea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truth, that this ſelfe ſame body ſhal ryſe

               <p>Thys preſent hiſtorie of the Goſpell ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth before vs a notable miracle of a maiden rayſed vp agayne by Chriſt. Whiche deede we muſte not ſo take, as though Chriſt dyd ſignifie, that all deade men before they be buried muſte be called agayne into this life, whiche is temporall, wretched, and ſubiecte to death, but his purpoſe was to ſtabliſhe the truth of his Goſpell, and by the waye to declare alſo thys thynge, that the fruite of his Goſpell, and heauenlie ryches, pertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not only to aged me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo to yonge perſonnes.

               <p>God alſo wyll ſette before our eyes tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe ſuche exemples howe vncerteyne the lotte of thys lyfe is, and admoniſhe vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyth, that we paſſe not ouer thys lyfe wyth negligence, and ſluggiſhnes, but ſeing wythout Chriſte there is no ſaluation, nor bliſfulnes, that we prepare our ſelues to the true knowledge of Chriſte, and to chriſtian obedience. Furthermore he woulde declare the greatnes of original ſynne, by the death of thys yonge perſonne. For though after mannes iudgement there be greater hope of ſaluation in the death of a yonge man, in whom ſo greate outwarde ſynnes be not founde, as in men of more age, yet in theyr cauſes we muſte vſe Goddes iudgemente, and not mannes. Neither oughte we in anie wyſe to thynke, that anie man ſhall obteyne ſaluation thorowe his owne innocencie. But ſeinge that death, whiche is the rewarde of ſynne, inuadeth both yonge and olde, it is a playne teſtimonie, that they be not free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſynne, but are comprehended in that general ſentence of Paule to the Romaines, where he ſayeth, by one man ſynne entred into the world, and death thorow ſinne, and ſo death
<pb facs="tcp:4169:257"/> went ouer all men, foraſmuche as we haue ſynned.</p>
               <p>Furthermore the nature of ſinne vttereth it ſelfe euen in chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they growe in age by ſundrie fruites of vices.</p>
               <p>Wherfore God forfende, that we ſhould thynke that yonge men obteyne ſaluation thorowe the merite of their owne innocencie. Yea they oughte aſwell as olde menne to acknowledge, that they receyue theyr whole ſaluation thorowe the innocencie of Chriſt. Wherfore that yonge men maye be ſaued, they muſte needes enioye the innocencie of Chriſte. For as Peter ſayeth, there is none other name gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to men, wherein they muſt be ſaued, but in the name of Ieſus Chriſte. Nowe yonge folke, are ſo planted in Chriſte thorowe Baptiſme, that they are made his lyuely me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres, &amp; by that meanes haue right to all his goodes. For Paule ſayeth, al you that be baptiſed haue putte on Chriſte. For as before God there is neither bondma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor free, neither male, nor female, ſo there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chylde nor olde man, but all we be one in Chriſte Ieſu. Vndoubtedly Chriſte hath deſerued thorowe his death forgyuenes of ſynne, and is riſſen agayne from death.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is a thynge ryghte certeyne, that younge folke alſo beinge Baptiſed in
<pb facs="tcp:4169:257" rendition="simple:additions"/> Chriſte, haue alreadie obteyned remiſſion of ſynnes, and that it is not poſſible, that they ſhoulde vtterly periſhe in death, but contrarie wyſe they muſte needes be rayſed vp agayne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life thorowe Chriſt. For ſo Paule ſayth, we are buried with him thorowe Baptiſme vnto death. If we be grafted in hym, by the lykenes of his death, we ſhall alſo be partakers of his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Seinge then thys yonge perſonne, whoſe corpſe we broughte forth euen nowe, was baptiſed in the name of Chriſt, and brought vp in Chriſtian doctrine, and moreouer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Chriſt to be his only ſaluation and openly declared this his fayth, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatynge at the Lordes Supper, ſurely we haue a good hope, that this death, is not death in deede, but rather is a ſleepe vnto hym, out of whiche ſleepe he ſhall be rayſed inconuenient tyme, vnto the poſſeſſion of the inheritaunce of the heauenly kyngdome.</p>

               <p>TThe paſtours, and teachers of con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gregacyons ſhall dilygently teach the people what true faſtynge is out of thoſe thynges, that we haue touched before concerninge Chriſtian faſte. For thereby anye man maye eaſely ſe, that a true faſte, and ſuche as wee beginne out of true fayth, muſt be taken vpon vs willingly with true repentaunce, and wyth a godlye
<pb facs="tcp:4169:262" rendition="simple:additions"/> geale to make our ſupplicacious to God, not bi anie neceſſite of a lawe, not for the cuſtome of men, other wyſe they ſhall teach that it is not only of none effecte before God, but is alſo abominacion vnto hym. For it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that, that wil to faſte, that repentaunce, and deſire to praye humbly to God, can be ſtiered vp by no commaundement outward<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly vſed. For we haue not receiued the ſpirite of Chriſt by the lawe, but thorough the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe of the Goſpell. Gala. iij. Wherefore nether the Lorde himſelfe Chriſte, nor the A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſtles or the ſaintes either after them, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed anye certayne daye for faſtinge by a lawe, but only exhorted the congregacion, and euerie Chriſtian man to faſt godli, their conſciences in the meane while beinge bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de with no lawe. So in the olde teſtament faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge was commaunded by the lawe only vpon one daye in the yere. Wherefore it can not become vs the miniſters of the new teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, not of the letter, but of the ſpirite, to make lawes of faſtynge, and there wyth to ſnare the conſciences of Chriſtian people.</p>
               <p>Therefore we thincke it ſhalbe ſufficient, that the paſtours exhorte the people dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to godlie faſtes, and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faſting daies to allure them with thoſe exerciſes of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whyche the fathers alſo vſed.

               <p>Further more lette them declare that the obſeruacion of lente was inſtituted of the olde fathers for thys purpoſe, that if anie in the reſt of the yere had fallen in to ſome gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uous ſinnes, or liued careleſly, being touched

               <p>For we can not wel hope that the olde ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner of faſtinge maye be called againe chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among vs Germaines which was to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer meate vnto the euening, and to beſtowe the whole daie in holie doctrin, and praiers.

               <p> GOd hath comprehended in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges of the prophetes and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, hys doctrine of ſaluacion, whereby he bringeth men to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtinge life, and ſheweth vs awaye to calle vpon him, and to praye to hym fore thinges, that be verie neceſſarie to paſſe furth this pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent life handſomely, and honeſtly. He hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that men be taught this doctrine moſt dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tli and, that it be lerned, and kept perpetualy. And this is a ſingular benifit of God, that he preſerueth hys worde beinge ſette furth in certayne bokes, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning, vnto the ende of the worlde, wherein we haue a ſure knowlege, and doctrine of hym, to lyue godly, and bliſfully, and by the ſame we maye lerne the beginning the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynge furth, and the ſpreadinge abrode of thys doctriue, in to the hole worlde. Thys benifite I ſaie of God is right excellent, and verie ineſtimable wherefore that ſtudie, and care, wherewith me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> labour, that this boke of lyfe, and euerlayſtinge ſaluacion maye be kepte ſincere, and faythfully taught and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to men, that they maye lerne thereby the true knowlege of God, is vndoubtedly an office of godlines, &amp; a ſeruice of god moſt acceptable. For which cauſe God inſtituted the kyngedome of Iuda, and mainteined it wonderfully ſo manye hundred yeres, name
<pb facs="tcp:4169:277"/> ly that there mighte be a people, a monge whome this booke ſhoulde be rightly kepte, and a monge whom there ſhoulde remayne ſure teſtimone is of God, and of his wyl to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs, vnto the cominge of Chriſt.

               <p>Seinge than that God, and our father re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gardeth ſo much that this boke be religiouſli kepte, taught and lerned, it is ſurely the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of all princes, and of them that miniſtre the comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale, to erecte Scholes, and ſo to prouide mete teachers for the ſame, and ſuch maner of teaching the youth of Chriſt, that thys heauenlie doctrine comprehended in the holie Byble, maye euer be kepte pure and faythfully taught in the congregacion.</p>
               <p>For thys cauſe it is well knowen, that at the beginning the Apoſtles euer inſtituted ſcholes in the congregations.</p>
               <p>There be moreouer other liberal ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, right goodlie giftes of God, whereby great commodites are procured to the comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyfe of men, and preſerued, whyche alſo be verie neceſſarie for the ciuile adminiſtracion of the worldly matters.

               <p>Wherefore we wyl, that in euerie towne aſwel ſmale, as great, latine ſcholes be erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the behofe of the youth, as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of euerie place wyll ſuffer. And that the ſcholemaſters, and ſuch as ſhal worcke with them in ſcholaſticale labour, may haue theyr rewarde and wages with leſſe charge of the people, we wyll by thaduiſe, and aſſente of oure dioſeſanes after that we haue tried the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modite thereof, depute certaine vicarages, and other prebe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des to this vſe.

               <p>Further more what order ſhalbe kepte in euerie ſchoole, what fourmes there ſhalbe, what howres ſhalbe appoynted to teach the youth: the ſcholmaſter ſhal ſo order, as it ſhal ſeme moſte conuenient for the teachinge of
<pb facs="tcp:4169:278"/> children, after that he hath conſulted wyth the paſtour, and ſuche as we ſhal make viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, or ouerſeers of this matter peculierly. For as in other thynges ſo in ſchooles alſo a conuenient order is of greate importaunce. The ſholemaſters, and theyr fellowes ſhall haue theyr office inioyned vnto them by the conſul of euerie place, the paſtour beinge pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent. To theſe perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the ſcholemaſters ſhal promiſe, that they wyll applye theyr office faythfully &amp; teach the youth after thys ſorte</p>
               <p>Firſt that they wyll teach the chyldren of the loweſt fourme to reade, and write, and for that purpoſ they ſhal vſe latyne bookes, wherein is the Lordes praier, the crede, &amp; the ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes, and ſuch like thynges pertainyng to the inſtitution of chyldren in religion, ſo that wyth the firſt letters they may acquaynte theym ſelues wyth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes of godlines.

And the ſchole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters ſhall preſcriebe to theſe children cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne latine wordes or ſentences daily in the eueninge whyche they ſhal render the next daye in the moringe. They whiche haue ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to reade, and beginne to aſſaye to write, ſhalbe remoued to another fourme. And the boke of Cato ſhalbe red vnto them, and thei ſhalbe ſette to lerne Donate wythout boke
<pb facs="tcp:4169:278" rendition="simple:additions"/> whom whan they haue learned, ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men grammer ſhalbe ſette before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they ſhall alſo lerne wythout booke in order worde bi worde. And the high procuratours of ſcholes ſhall principaully haue a regarde hereunto, that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lerne ſome certaine and regular grammer. For that is neceſſarie for manie cauſes. But bicauſe greate labour and continuall repeticion is requiſite to the printinge of grammaticall rules in childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the children themſelues abhorre from thys labour, the moſt parte of ſholemaſters neglect the rules of grammar, or teache the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> negligently and make haſte to the readinge of poets, and Tullie, and ſuch like authors, whyche is pleaſaunter both to the teachers, and heares, than the perpetual repeticion of the rules of grammare is. But by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous maner of teachinge, the youth is greatli hindred, for thei neuer lerne to ſpeake certaineli, and purely, whan they be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to certayne rules of ſpeakynge. Wherefore the ſholemaſters muſt be enioy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned with ſingular diligence, and bounde by an other to teache a certayne accuſtoumed, and reguler grammer, and certayne precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of ſpeakinge, &amp; to beate in the ſame with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t interrogaciones, and anſweres that they maye be grammarians, and knowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certayne

In thys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie than of the ſeconde fourme, the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhalbe reteined ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, til they haue perfectly lerned Donate, and al grammar rules.

               <p>And the thynges that ſhalbe interpreted vpon one daye aboute eueninge, they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues ſhall interprete the ſame the nexte daye, with the declinacion, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iugacion of ſome nownes, and verbes, wher rules of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre, caſe, preterperfectetens, &amp; ſupine ſhalbe demaunded of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as al good ſcholmaſters know they muſt do, and wil do alſo diligent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly. Further more this fourme muſt be daily exerciſed in writinge, and euerie one ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyuer to the maſter ſome enioyned writinge</p>
               <p>After the children haue lerned the Etimo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>logie or rules of grammare metely well, a thirde fourme ſhal be appointed of ſuche, as haue profited ſo far in learninge. To theſe children the maſters ſhal expoune Tirence, and the Aeneis of Virgil, and they muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cure, that they learne perfectly the rules of conſtruction which the maſters ſhal declare with plaine, and euident exemples. Further in the repetion of a leſſon, theſe two exerciſes
<pb facs="tcp:4169:279" rendition="simple:additions"/> muſt be diligently retained, namely that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do euer declare the conſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the text, and alſo adde the rules ſo that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the coniugations, and declinations and ſhewe the rules of the ſame. In this exerciſe of repetinge, and examininge, a lerned, and faithful maſter ſhal teach, how manie waies the ſame ſentence maye be ſpoken in latine, with ſuch declaracions of the propriete, and elegancie of the latine toung, they ſhal cauſe more plentious fruit than may be here fully expreſſed. But this matter conſiſteth altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the faythfulnes, and dexterite of the maſter. Wherfore men thoroughly learned faythfull, and prompte in teachinge, muſt be ſought furth, to haue the gouernance of ſcho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les, cheifely in greate townes.</p>
               <p>In thys fourme there ſhalbe a certayne howre appoynted euerye weeke, at whyche howre the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal reherſe wythout boke the rules of grammar, that they forget them not. The maſters maye alſo change thir lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in the howre deputed to virgil, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poune Tullies epiſtles. In thys furme alſo euerie childe ſhall write, and delyuer euery weeke a latine Epiſtle, that together thei may learne both to ſpeake &amp; to write latyne</p>
               <p>The fourth fourme ſhalbe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche haue lerned theyr grammare rules, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and haue attained a metly good la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyne
<pb facs="tcp:4169:280"/> toung. To the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afterwarde ſome logike ſhalbe red, as the logik of Ceſarius, Philip, or Sturmius, and ſome eaſie accentinge, as of Murmelius, or ſome other lyke. In thys fourme more ouer ſome bookes of Ouides Metamorphoſis, de Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to, and Tullies of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices ſhalbe red, The childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this fourme ſhal alſo be ſterred vp to write verſes which they ſhall deliuer to the maſter euerie month. But foraſmuch as manie be of that nature, that thei lern to mak verſes with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cultie, the ſhole maſter ſhal vſe ſuch modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion in requiringe thys ſtudie, that he maye exerciſe euerie one in that, that he ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue the nature of euerie one, to preuaile in. Howe be it he ſhall exhorte the dulle alſo to this arte, that thei do not vtterly caſte a waie thys art, for the greate profite, which it hath vndoubtedly.

Theſe men ſhal exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what maner of paſtours, and miniſters be in euerie congregation. For if the people ſhal be ryghtly brought to Chriſt the Lorde and be inſtituted, &amp; edified in faith towardes hym, they muſte needes haue ſuche guydes, and paſtours, as be learned vnto the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, as ſaynte Paule preſcribeth vnto his diſciples Timothe and Tite, and ſuch as burne wyth a zeale to brynge many therunto, finally ſuche as be meete to teache other to keepe thoſe thynges that Chriſte hath commaunded vs all to keepe, ſo that the paſtours and miniſters be furniſhed to teache other, faſte keepers of the faythfull worde, that they may be able to exhorte tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe holeſome doctrine, and confute them, that gayneſaye the ſame. For if the ſalte be made vnſauerie, no thynge ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſalted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyth, and if the light be darkened, darkenes obſcureth all thynges.

Wherefore by the healpe of God we wyll procure wyth as great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence as we can, that in oure dominion ſuche be made paſtours, and miniſters ouer congregations, as wyth vnfeyned diligence laboure to lyue accordynge to the Canon taught of the holie goſte by the miniſterie of ſaynt Paule, and moſte ſtraitely required by all the Canons of the holie fathers, though being letted thorowe mannes weaknes they can not perfectly atteyne to the ſame, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles at the leſte in the principall matters whiche perteyne to the holie miniſterie, they ſhall ordre all theyr doinges accordynge to thys Canon.

For where
<pb facs="tcp:4169:289" rendition="simple:additions"/> thys zeale wanteth, there lyuely fayth can not be, nor the true knowledge of Chriſte. Howe can ſuche then teache fruitefully, and be meete witneſſes of the fayth in Chriſte? For, aſmuche as they buyld wyth doctrine, ſo muche they pull doune agayne with their vncleane lyfe. For it can not be that ſuche ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly teache true doctrine, ſeinge they loue not God truely. Wherefore it is muche more tollerable to haue fewe, and the ſame verie godly paſtours, and feruent in the zeale of Chriſt, tyl God him ſelfe vouch ſafe to thruſte forth more meete workmen in to his harneſt, then to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though they be neuer ſo ſmall, to their faythfulnes, whiche them ſelues knowe not Chriſt.

               <p>And that al vnchaſtnes, and vncleane life may bemore eaſely turned awaye from the miniſters of the congregations, we beſeche, exhort and require of them al, whiche be now ſet ouer the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations, or ſhal be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that wyth all diligence they ordre theyr lyfe ſo godly, temperately, chaſtly, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they maye be guydes to the people

               <p>But to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and holily without mariage, we thynke it not our parte to forbidde them holie mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. But thys we beſeche them, and require of them, that if they wyl entre into holy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, they entre into it holily, and in the Lorde, that is to ſaye, lette them ſeeke them ſelues ſuche wyues, as they maye well hope ſhalbe an healpe to them, not onely to leade forth theyr priuate lyfe godly, and wythout reprofe, but alſo to execute the holie miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation more readely, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly. Let them then deſire of the Lorde, and wyth godly dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce let them ſeeke wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men excellinge in religion, and all honeſtie, godly, and holily brought vp, hauyng good teſtimonie amonge the congregation. For the holie goſte requireth ſuche wyues of the miniſters of the congregation, and the verie great neceſſitie of the congregations requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the ſame.</p>
               <p>They that deſire to marie them, whom they had for concubines before, ſhall not be permitted ſo to do wythout the conſent of
<pb facs="tcp:4169:290" rendition="simple:additions"/> the viſitors, whiche ſhall determine herein that, that ſhall ſeme to be profitable for the congregation, and conuenient for the holie miniſterie. For euen the familie of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours muſt garniſhe the Goſpel of Chriſt, and theyr wyues muſte be an exemple to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiues in al godlineſſe, and chaſtitie. As the holy goſte commaunded by S. Paule.</p>
               <p>Secondly we haue determined to admit no man to thys miniſterie, nor to ſuffre anie therein, whiche applieth not the readynge of the holie Bible, and hath not profited ſo far in chriſtian doctrine, and lyfe, and alſo in the knowledge of adminiſtringe the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, that at the leſt he be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the cuſtomable, and communely vſed leſſons, whiche are wonte to be propouned to the whole congregation out of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and conueniently handle by the ſame the principal articles of oure doctrine, and moreouer enſtructe tollerably chyldren, and more aged folke, yea the vniuerſal people of Chriſt, in the religion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly whereas that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may rightly ordre the holy miniſterie, &amp; profitably ſerue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations therin, it is neceſſarie, that he entangle not hym ſelfe in the buſines of thys lyfe, but gyue hym ſelfe wholy with al diligence to readyng, doctrine, &amp; prayer, we
<pb facs="tcp:4169:291"/> exhort and require by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of Chriſt, and by the authoritie of our archebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoply office, of al paſtours, and curates of ſoules, that they vtterly bid al worldly, and fleſhly cares, and buſines farewel, and caſte the ſame fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as (beſide the lawe of god) the canons require with great ſeueritie. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the neceſſaries of life, we wil faith fully procure, that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhalbe liberally prouided for, that beinge diſcharged of the care of this lyfe, they maye wholy gyue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues both to lerne the holy ſcripture, and to ſtudy the ſame day and night, whiche onely enſtructeth vnto ſaluation thorowe fayth in Chriſt, and alſo to prayers, wyth which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may obteyne the true vnderſtandyng of the ſcripture, and the gift and grace to de liuer the ſame wholſomely vnto other, and luckely to ſerue Chriſt the Lorde in thys of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto the edification of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund that the paſtours haue often co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uocations, and godly exerciſes in the ſame, whiche we wyl appoynte in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne, and conuenient places, and tymes, as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhall ſuffre, and herein they ſhall vſe none excuſe, excepte it be verie neceſſarie.</p>
               <p>In theſe conuocations one ſhall faythful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, enſtructe, warne, and exhorte an other of
<pb facs="tcp:4169:291" rendition="simple:additions"/> the ſincere vnderſtandyng of the ſcriptures, and of the holeſome adminiſtracion of their office. For ſeing that the knowledge, and vſe of a paſtorall office, is ſo miſerably loſt, we wyll appoynte by oure viſitors, as much as we maye, ſome paſtours, and teachers in cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine places, which be ſome what more fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the knowledge, and religion of the holie miniſterie, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e the other paſtours and miniſters dweling nigh aboute, ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorte euery weke, or as often as it ſhalbe con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenient, and ſhal heare of them the expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſcriptures, and other thinges perta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning to paſtoral cure, &amp; ſo better furniſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues vnto their office. And if caſes, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cultes hape<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in theyr miniſterie, out of which thei can not vnfolde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe the counſel of theſe men. And if they be warned that thei haue erred, or don amis in ani thing let them take that warninge in good parte, and regarde it wel, and diligentli amend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues in that, wherein they erred, and lette them, if they haue not, fully execuited theyr office in anye pointe, recompenſe the ſame ſtudiouſly.</p>
               <p>Further more we wil alſo inſtitute great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conuocations to be kepe twiſe a yere, and beſide thoſe we wyll haue two to be kepte e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie yere in our cite of Colone, as the olde

               <p>To theſe conuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s than, the paſtours and Deanes euery man according to his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre, ſhal come together ſtudiouſlye, neyther ſhal they abſent them ſelues from thens, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be for a neceſſary cauſe, we wil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyde alſo that euery congregation ſhalbe vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſited euery yeare by mete viſiters, whiche if they haue perceiued any faute to haue crept into the pariſhes, which thei them ſelues ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not amende, they ſhall propoune the ſame in the greater conuocations, that it maye be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by the authoritie of a ſynode. Wher for we wyl chuſe men excellyng in wyſdom faythfulnes and authoritie, aſmuche as the Lord ſhal geue, to rule this conuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and to execute viſitations, to whom we wil geue ſuch authoritie, that they maye reſiſt fautes, and inconueniences whan they aryſe, and vſe fit remedies.</p>
               <p>Nowe all the actes of conuocations, and viſitations muſt be referred hereunto, that al pariſhes may haue faythful, and mete mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſters, whych may execute their miniſterye faythfully accordyng to Gods worde, and want not iuſt defence againſt vniuſt viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and cauillations of wicked menne. And that

Final<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, foraſmuch as ſondry chaunſes, &amp; diſeaſes and other lets of the holy miniſtery happen dayly vnto paſtours, as vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this thing ſhal alſo be decreed in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uocations, &amp; viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it happeneth to ſome miniſter by reaſon of ſiknes, or ſome other cauſe, that he cannot execute his miniſtery himſelfe, that ſome of his felowes, if ther be ſondry mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the ſame congregation, as it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in tounes or ſome of his neighbours, if any haue no felow, as it is wont to be in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, ſhal ſupply the rome of the miniſter, ſo empeſched, that the peple be not ani wher defrauded of the holye miniſtery of Chriſt.</p>

Finally he ſhall faythfully exequite his wounted of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the chapter houſes, in demaundinge of ſentences, and in ſpeakinge, and aunſwering In the name of the chapter.</p>
               <p>After the ſame ſorte other Canons alſo muſt faithfully applie their office, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie aſwel noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as prieſtes in reading, and in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dlinge matters of the college in the Chapter, and obeinge theyr prelates, as it is conuenient.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to the college and the chapter in doubts that ſhalariſe, and that they maye exequite foraine buſines. And we woulde this diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucion of offices ſo to be ordred amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g prei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, that yet all ſhoulde be fellowes of the Chap. and ſhould haue their place there, and ſaye theyr mindes.</p>
               <p>In like maner let the diacons applie their office not onely in reading the Goſpel at the holie Euchariſtia, but alſo in taking charge of the poore, and diſtributinge to the poore after the pleaſure of the Chap. the thynges, that they which communicate at the Lordes table, ſhall offre vnto the Lorde.</p>
               <p>Nether muſt the vicares be idle lette them be preſent in the Quiar, whan the tyme ſhall require let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue eare to the holie lectures and ſermons. and endeuour that the ſame be done religiouſly, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ely, further let them ſerue the people of Chriſt vnto edificacion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to the gift that God hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him in other miniſteries of the cleargy</p>
               <p>As for thoſe which heretofore were bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to ſaye priuate maſſes, we wil haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune maſſes religiouſli, and that

               <p>And bicauſe there be manie vicares, which after this reformacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal haue no miniſterie in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregacion beſide holie lectures, and ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, it ſemeth not an euil aduiſe vnto vs, if ſome prebendes of vicares after their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, whiche now haue them, be turned to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and better vſes by the counſel, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente of our dioceſanes.</p>
               <p>And foraſmuche as we ſe not, as we ſaide before, that it lieth in our power, to forbidde holie mariage to be vſed of anie man in the Lord, we wil that the congregations be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, therein, that the children or wyues of the miniſters deteine not the eccleſiaſticall reuenues after the death of the miniſters, but that al thinges returne to the congregacion furth wyth after the death of anie miniſter.

               <p>After this ſorte we wiſh that our principal colege be renuid. Which waye and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we deſire that it maye alſo preuaile in S.
<pb facs="tcp:4169:297" rendition="simple:additions"/> Gereous college. Nether do we go abonte to bring in anie chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge in other colleges, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Canons, and vicares of all colleges firſt confirme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to the fourme preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed in this boke in doctrine, celebration of maſſes, and other ceremonies, and that there fore they moderate and vſe theyr holie leſſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and ſounges in temples after the maner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before, &amp; whiche we wil declare more largely, hereafter. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dli that they prouide the pariſches, and ſcholes, which thei haue in corporated, of mete miniſters, and gyue to the ſame liberally the neceſſaries of life, that they maie applie their miniſteries to the true profite of the congregacion. Finally that in life, and maners they be an exemple vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of godlynes, and honeſtie, auoiding all ſpottes, and offences in theyr conuerſacion, aſmuche as they maye by the Lordes helpe.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it is wel knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt parte of poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s came to colleges tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the liberalite of princes, erles, &amp; knig h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, concerninge ſecondarie colleges we wyl ſeke theſe waies by the aduiſe, and aſſente of our men, that partli thei ſhalbe adiudged to the nobilite, ſo that none ſhalbe receiued in to them but gentlemen, partly they ſhalbe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to other honeſt men, vnder thys condici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they proue their nobilite from theyr

               <p>As touchinge preſbiteral prebendes in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther colleges, we wil that they be beſtowed vpon ſectures of diuinite, holie ſermons, and miniſtracion of the ſecramentes, and further more vpon lawiers and ſuch as gyue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to the colleges in temporal matters. And as touching the procuration of holie ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and inſtitucion, and maintenaunce of ſcholes we wil haue al theſe thynges ſo ordred, and kepte, as we haue preſcrided to our principal college, aſmuch as the commoditie and facul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties of euerie college wil ſuſteine,</p>
               <p>And it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient that to thoſe principal miniſteries, where preſbiteral prebe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te or ſuffice not, other prebendes be adiudged, and incorporated.</p>
               <p>Thus we wil alſo haue the ſame waye ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerued, in vicares, &amp; diaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of other colleges which we haue ſet furth in our high college.</p>
               <p>Veſſels of ſiluer, and golde, and other coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie veſſels and ornamentes of churches, and colleges thorough our dioceſe, we wil haue be put in an innentorie, and to be kepte dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, and that none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be alienated from their congregations, and colleges, or chaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged
<pb facs="tcp:4169:298" rendition="simple:additions"/> to another vſe with out the lawful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of vs, and oure prouincials. Wee haue obſerued alſo that the time of vacance in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny colleges is required longer, than it is con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenient, whereby the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregacions are long deſtitute of their miniſteries, and the newe miniſters are burthened to much. Therefore that we may moderate this thing according to equitie, we wil that the tyme of wantinge new felowes be not prolonged more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one yere. But as ſone as euerie man hath lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obteyned a prebende, lete him enioye it after the firſt yere, without anie diminucion excepte therebe ſome lawful, and cananical impediment.</p>
               <p>We haue obſerued thys thynge alſo that reſidence of the firſt yere in manie colleges is required to preciſeli, and ſcrupuluſly, with out anie neceſſarie, or profitable cauſe. By whych ſuperſticion manye fellowes are dra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wen from thoſe miniſteries of which agreat deale more profite myght come both to the colleges, and alſo to the congregacions, than if they ſhoulde be preſent euerie howre. Yea and other inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modites, and herte burninges are wounte to aryſe we will therefore that a remedie be laied to thys incommodite, and that the lawes of reſidence be ſo tempred, as Chriſtian charite, and true edificacion of the
<pb facs="tcp:4169:299"/> congregacions ſhall require, and as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; facultes of euerie college ſhal permit</p>
               <p>Finally we haue marcked that thoſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that ſtudie in vniuerſites, be worſe en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>treated, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> right woulde. It pleaſeth vs ther fore that hereafter hole prebendes be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche by the permiſſion of theyr Chap, liue in vniuerſites, and apyroued ſcho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les, howe beit ſuche moderacion ſhalbe vſed herein, as ſhalbe agreable to euerie mannes age, witte, and ſtudie. For ſeinge that al eccle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiaſtical prebendes were appointed for thys only purpoſe, that they, whiche are ſuſteined thereby ſhoulde profitably ſerue the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacions, and ſet forth their commodites, ſure<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly it is muche mor right, and more worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and profitable both for the colleges, and alſo for the congregation to geue hole prebe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>So it ſemeth good to vs alſo that monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of beggynge friers be wholy dedicated to godly learnyng.

For oure weaknes is verie much in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng in good, and honeſt ſtudies, and our old enemie Sathan layeth meruailous waites a gainſte al chriſtian reformacion of thinges.

               <p>And therfore we exhort in the Lord moſt erneſtlye all virgins, cloyſterers and other whych are nowe in Abbaies, that they take good hede that this ſo neceſſarye, and hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome worke of chriſtian reformation be not made open in any part to the il ſpeakyng of men nor hindred, nor defaced wyth anye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, or offence, ſeyng that very many ſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyng blockes, and lettes otherwyſe happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this worke, before it come to any purpoſe and be eſtabliſhed, throughe ſo great weke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of men, and ſo ſharpe and continuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waytes of Satan.</p>

It moderateth the praiſe therof I ſay ſo ſtudiouſli, and with ſo ſinguler a promiſe that as often as it bryngeth furth any thing in the commendation of thys wyueles lyfe, and of the maner of ſeruyng. God wythout Mariage, it addeth furthwyth ſomewhat, wherby it admoniſheth that it is not geuen to euery body to ſerue God out of wedlock and that eueri man ought to conſider, what gift he hath receiued of the Lord, leſt labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge to higher thynges, he bee not able to ſtand in the lower, and leſt whyle he folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the higher vertue, he leſe the lower, and laye a ſnare for himſelfe.

               <p>Seyng than that the Lord himſelfe, and maſter of religion comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth wineles lyfe after this ſort, and with this warines bothe by hymſelfe, and by his Apoſtle, it cannot ſurely be lawful to vs his diſciples, to laye a ſnare to men commeuded to oure charge,

For as the Lorde wyll haue nothynge commaunded to manne in his name, but that, that certaynly pertayneth to his welth, ſo he wyll haue no vowe either to bee commended or required, whiche helpeth not to the ſame. For he came to ſaue that, that of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had periſhed, and not to bryng them into anye daunger of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>Out of theſe commaundementes of the Lorde we admoniſhe and exhort in the Lorde and in his name, al virgines, cloiſterers, and al other men, what ſo euer they be, that they wyl godly conſidre, and lay vp in theyr her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes al theſe commaundementes of the Lorde that they trouble not them at any tyme with vntymely mariages, to whom they owe all honour, reuerence, and loue, and ſo diſwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyppe the Goſpel of Chriſte, and be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation of God, and to other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which offenſe by the healpe of God thei might auoied. For if any aſke of God with true fayth, and cal for his ſpirite in the name of his ſonne oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, he wyl not denie his healpe to the perfourmance of thoſe thynges, whiche he ſo muche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and requireth. Whiche thynge we ſee
<pb facs="tcp:4169:304"/> dayly in ſo many holy maydens, and wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, whom he preſerueth in ryght puritie of lyfe, wythout all foule ſuperſtition, and offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, while there chaunce to them no meete huſbandes, to whom they myghte be mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And there is no gyfte ſurely perteynyng to the edifiyng, and adournynge of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, but God wyl bountuouſly gyue it vs euen in this tyme, ſo that we do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpice, nor caſte away his liberalitie, but ſeeke and praye for the ſame godly. Wherefore God wyll gyue no leſſe in thys tyme, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, and wydowes, and other holie men, whiche ſhall gelde them ſelues for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, then he dyd in the tyme of the holie fathers, if we ſhal godly require of hym theſe ornamentes of the congregation. And there be ſome ſurelye in thys tyme, to whome the gyfte of godlye wyueles lyfe hath chaunced from God, if onely they wyl vſe the ſame in the true feare of God, and zeale of promotynge the Goſpell. Therfore let al cloiſterers wyth al diligence, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes beware, that they abuſe not the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Chriſte in any thynge, and make the good thynge, whiche they haue receyued of the Lorde, and the profeſſion of the Goſpell to be ſubiect to the yl ſpeakyng of men. But that they loke aboute them religiouſly, trie
<pb facs="tcp:4169:304" rendition="simple:additions"/> and diſcerne, whither the Lorde hath called them, and doth cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not whither carnal curioſitie and deſire dryueth them, which yet the Lorde wyl giue them grace to ouercome if onely they wyl diligently pray for it, and labour ſtudioſly to thys poynte, and facion thys whole lyfe wyth godly care, that they maye approue them ſelues to all men, but chiefely to them amonge whom they liue by Goddes ordinaunce, that they maye pleaſe them I ſaye unto theyr wealth, and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſeeke theyr owne in nothynge, but the thynges that profite other, as the Lorde requireth of all chriſten men by Paule.</p>
               <p>To al theſe thynges we warne, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort cloiſterers after that ſort, and religion, that Paule dyd namely for the true profite of cloiſterers, for that, that is comely to them and healpeth them hereunto, that they maye cleaue the better to the Lorde, and more nigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, and wyth leſſe daunger of ſeperation.</p>
               <p>And not in any wyſe after that ſort, &amp; ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, that we ſhoulde laye a ſnare to anie man, that is to ſaye, that we ſhoulde gyue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſion, to enterpriſe more thynges, and higher, then euerie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath receyued power of the Lorde, as we proteſted before.

For it is better to be mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then to burne, what ſo euer men agaynſte the ſame haue willed, or commaunded, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thorowe theyr authoritie, or fauour. For againſt that, that the Lord pronounceth to be better, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mai vowe or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund, or require, or perfourme by any meanes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we beſeche, and exhorte in the Lorde the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and kinſfolke of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſonnes, that in them, whom God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to theyr charge, which were borne of them, and be ioined to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by bloude, or ſome other diuine copulation, they wyll not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre temporall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modites, and ornamentes before euerlaſtyng, and that they wyl rather conſidre thys thynge well, and religiouſly, that our whole wealth lyeth in the free, and bolde inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Goddes mercie, thorowe our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. Which inuocation can not ſtande wyth an euyl conſcience. But they whiche burne bicauſe they haue not the gyfte of geldyng them ſelues for the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, if they refuſe the remedie of burnynge, that is to witte, holie wedlocke, they can verie ſcantly maintaine a good con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience. For who ſo whyle he maye, ſtudieth not to embrace that, that God hath iudged better, he vndoudtedly diſpireth god, whoſe

It is better to be maried, then to burne. And it oughte to comforte godly parentes, whom God hath honoured, rather then burthened wyth a greate meanie of chyldren, that he hath promiſed, that all other thynges ſhalbe added vnto them, which ſeeke the kingdome of God, and the ryghtuouſnes thereof, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe his prouidence, whiche ſurely can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leaue his deſtitute of anie maner of true commodities.

Furthermore how horrible a thing ſhould it be to be heard, that chriſtian, &amp; noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or other wyſe exccelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thorowe the ſinguler benifites of the Lorde, ſhoulde wyllyngly for temporal ritches, and worldf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly glorie putte theyr chyldren in daunger o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternall damnation, and laye before them a ſnare of ſynne, whom they had begotte to God, to enioye eternall lyfe, and not to the diuyll to ſuffre euerlaſtyng damnation, and whom alſo they had conſecrated to Chriſte, to keepe al the thinges that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded. Wo be vnto them, ſayeth the Lorde, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an occaſion of ſtumblyng commeth.</p>
               <p>And if we hereafter by the councell, and aduiſe of our prouinciall ſtates, can healpe godly, and honeſte men aſwell noble, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whiche haue more chyldren, then they can, wel ioyne in matrimonie accordynge to theyr eſtate, that they maye couple all theyr chyldren whom the Lorde hath called to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wedlocke, in mariages meete for them, we wyl omitte no faythfulnes, and diligence. In the meane whyle lette the parentes, and kinſfolke which haue the gouerna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their yongers, laboure to ſhewe ſuche loue, and faythfulnes to theyr chyldren, and kinſfolke in thys behalfe, whereby they maye declare, that they deſire nothinge more, then the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
